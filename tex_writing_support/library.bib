@article{McMillan2010a,
abstract = {In order to quantify total error affecting hydrological models and predictions, we must explicitly recognize errors in input data, model structure, model parameters and validation data. This paper tackles the last of these: errors in discharge measurements used to calibrate a rainfall-runoff model, caused by stage-discharge rating-curve uncertainty. This uncertainty may be due to several combined sources, including errors in stage and velocity measurements during individual gaugings, assumptions regarding a particular form of stage-discharge relationship, extrapolation of the stage-discharge relationship beyond the maximum gauging, and cross-section change due to vegetation growth and/or bed movement. A methodology is presented to systematically assess and quantify the uncertainty in discharge measurements due to all of these sources. For a given stage measurement, a complete PDF of true discharge is estimated. Consequently, new model calibration techniques can be introduced to explicitly account for the discharge error distribution. The method is demonstrated for a gravel-bed river in New Zealand, where all the above uncertainty sources can be identified, including significant uncertainty in cross-section form due to scour and re-deposition of sediment. Results show that rigorous consideration of uncertainty in flow data results in significant improvement of the model's ability to predict the observed flow.

abstract = {Since its introduction in 2002/2003, the current generation of the Delft-FEWS operational forecasting platform has found application in over forty operational centres. In these it is used to link data and models in real time, producing forecasts on a daily basis. In some cases it forms a building block of a country-wide national forecasting system using distributed client-server technology. In other cases it is applied at a much smaller scale on a simple desktop workstation, providing forecasts for a single basin. The flexibility of the software in open integration of models and data has additionally appealed to the research community. This paper discusses the principles on which the Delft-FEWS system has been developed, as well as a brief background of the architecture of the system and concepts used for storing and handling data. One of the key features of the system is its flexibility in integrating (third-party) models and data, and the available approaches to linking models and accessing data are highlighted. A brief overview of different applications of the system is given to illustrate how the software is used to support differing objectives in the domain of real time environmental modelling. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {WEC-C is a distributed, deterministic, catchment-scale water flow and solute transport model containing a number of innovations not present in comparable models. For example, it allows for the imposition of catchment topological changes resulting from land uses such as surface mining. In addition, it features preferential vertical flow in the vadose zone modelled using a dual continuum approach. Numerically, it differs from many existing models in that it employs a direct linkage between the vertical and lateral solvers of its split-solver scheme and, due to its use of explicit solvers, is stable regardless of the form of the soil moisture characteristic curves. The WEC-C model framework is a rectangular grid of uniform cell size in the lateral plane combined with a system of soil layers, of variable thickness, in the vertical direction. Within this structure, the governing equations for flow and transport are discretised and solved. All parameters are defined locally in each computational cell so that all available data on catchment variability can be incorporated directly into the model. This paper describes the formulation of WEC-C, which is based on operator splitting with first-order accurate solvers for both the vertical and lateral flow and transport models. WEC-C was subjected to four stringent, synthetic tests designed to evaluate its accuracy by comparison with available analytical and numerical solutions. These showed that there were scale issues associated with the model, and that induced numeric dispersion of solutes could be significant. Nonetheless, it is suggested that WEC-C is still useful as a distributed catchment model.},

abstract = {Hydrologic modelers are confronted with the challenge of producing estimates of the uncertainty associated with model predictions across an array of catchments and hydrologic flow regimes. In order to obtain these uncertainty estimates, a numerical method must be selected for hydrologic model parameter estimation. Formal Bayesian approaches are often criticized for making strong assumptions about the nature of model residuals via the likelihood function that are not well satisfied, leading to inappropriate uncertainty estimates. This paper outlines a residual error model (likelihood function) specification framework that aims to address these issues through the development of a simple and straightforward procedure for building more appropriate residual error models that is both flexible and extendible. The design addresses the problems brought about by variability in model residuals as a function of hydrologic regime, including specific acknowledgement of the difficulties posed by continuous modeling of ephemeral catchments (e.g., zero-inflated residuals). In doing so, many of the likelihood function adaptations that have previously been used in application-specific settings were assembled within the selection framework. The framework was applied to four synthetic datasets of differing error structure in a stepwise manner, while also ensuring that each residual error model was investigated and assessed based on its ability to properly characterize the errors. Further, the framework was applied to a real dataset, the Black River catchment in Queensland, Australia. The results of these test applications indicated that a multifaceted assessment strategy is necessary to determine the adequacy of an individual likelihood function.},

abstract = {The need for estimating micropollutants fluxes in stormwater systems increases the role of stormwater quality models as support for urban water managers, although the application of such models is affected by high uncertainty. This study presents a procedure for identifying the major sources of uncertainty in a conceptual lumped dynamic stormwater runoff quality model that is used in a study catchment to estimate (i) copper loads, (ii) compliance with dissolved Cu concentration limits on stormwater discharge and (iii) the fraction of Cu loads potentially intercepted by a planned treatment facility. The analysis is based on the combination of variance-decomposition Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) with the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) technique. The GSA-GLUE approach highlights the correlation between the model factors defining the mass of pollutant in the system and the importance of considering hydrological parameters as source of uncertainty when calculating Cu loads and concentrations due to their influence. The influence of hydrological parameters on simulated concentrations changes during rain events. Four informal likelihood measures are used to quantify model prediction bounds. The width of the uncertainty bounds depends on the likelihood measure, with the inverse variance based likelihood more suitable for covering measured pollutographs. Uncertainty for simulated concentration is higher than for Cu loads, which again shows lower uncertainty compared to studies neglecting the hydrological submodel as source of uncertainty. A combined likelihood measure ensuring both good predictions in flow and concentration is used to identify the parameter sets used for long time simulations. These results provide a basis for reliable application of models as support in the development of strategies aiming to reduce discharge of stormwater micropollutants to the aquatic environment.

This watershed may be considered as representative of a large part of the country. Samples were taken each month from seven sites along the course of the river, plus one from its major affluent the Demer. The eight molecules monitored were the main herbicides used on the major crops in the area, plus some used in nonagricultural sectors. The concentrations found were mostly in the 0–3mg/L range, with some peaks between 3 and 14mg/L. The averages over all spring and summer samples analyzed ranged from 0.14 (bentazone) to 1.54 mg/L (diuron). Time and space specific patterns could be observed.},

@article{Sharifi2014b,
abstract = {One of the most important challenges in making activated sludge models (ASMs) applicable to design problems is identifying the values of its many stoichiometric and kinetic parameters. When wastewater characteristics data from full-scale biological treatment systems are used for parameter estimation, several sources of uncertainty, including uncertainty in measured data, external forcing (e.g. influent characteristics), and model structural errors influence the value of the estimated parameters. This paper presents a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for the probabilistic estimation of activated sludge process parameters. The method provides the joint probability density functions (JPDFs) of stoichiometric and kinetic parameters by updating prior information regarding the parameters obtained from expert knowledge and literature. The method also provides the posterior correlations between the parameters, as well as a measure of sensitivity of the different constituents with respect to the parameters. This information can be used to design experiments to provide higher information content regarding certain parameters. The method is illustrated using the ASM1 model to describe synthetically generated data from a hypothetical biological treatment system. The results indicate that data from full-scale systems can narrow down the ranges of some parameters substantially whereas the amount of information they provide regarding other parameters is small, due to either large correlations between some of the parameters or a lack of sensitivity with respect to the parameters.},

abstract = {Flow and transport models in heterogeneous geological formations are usually large-scale with excessive computational complexity and uncertain characteristics. Uncertainty quantification for predicting subsurface flow and transport often entails utilizing a numerical Monte Carlo framework, which repeatedly simulates the model according to a random field parameter representing hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer. The physical resolution (e.g. spatial grid resolution) for the simulation is customarily chosen based on recommendations in the literature, independent of the number of Monte Carlo realizations. This practice may lead to either excessive computational burden or inaccurate solutions. We develop an optimization-based methodology that considers the trade-off between the following conflicting objectives: time associated with computational costs, statistical convergence of the model prediction and physical errors corresponding to numerical grid resolution. Computational resources are allocated by considering the overall error based on a joint statistical-numerical analysis and optimizing the error model subject to a given computational constraint. The derived expression for the overall error explicitly takes into account the joint dependence between the discretization error of the physical space and the statistical error associated with Monte Carlo realizations. The performance of the framework is tested against computationally extensive simulations of flow and transport in spatially heterogeneous aquifers. Results show that modelers can achieve optimum physical and statistical resolutions while keeping a minimum error for a given computational time. The physical and statistical resolutions obtained through our analysis yields lower computational costs when compared to the results obtained with prevalent recommendations in the literature. Lastly, we highlight the significance of the geometrical characteristics of the contaminant source zone on the optimum physical and statistical resolutions.},

The aim of this paper is to propose an interfacing procedure between two widespread but specialised programming environments: ArcVIEW as a Geographical Information System (GIS) and Matlab as a scientific programming tool for numerical analysis. The proposed solution is based on a Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) between the two programs in order to operate a Matlab-based water quality model from within the GIS environment. It is shown how special GIS objects must be created and how they operate to achieve the goal of having quality data created by the model placed on a geographical map, together with other site features.},

Physically based equations are implemented to simulate the flow of water between adjacent cells. The model was validated against solutions of simple problems in both steady state and transient state conditions including analytical solutions and simulations performed with the MODFLOW-2000 model. The developed code is simple enough to facilitate its integration into other models such as land-surface models. The good performance without detriment to accuracy makes the model adequate to perform long simulation time analysis.},

@article{Pappenberger2005,
abstract = {The political pressure on the scientific community to provide medium to long term flood forecasts has increased in the light of recent flooding events in Europe. Such demands can be met by a system consisting of three different model components (weather forecast, rainfall runoff forecast and flood inundation forecast) which are all liable to considerable uncertainty in the input, output and model parameters. Thus, an understanding of cascaded uncertainties is a necessary requirement to provide robust predictions. In this paper, 10-day ahead rainfall forecasts, consisting of one deterministic, one control and 50 ensemble forecasts, are fed into a rainfall-runoff model (LisFlood) for which parameter uncertainty is represented by six different parameter sets identified through a Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) analysis and functional hydrograph classification. The runoff of these 52 * 6 realisations form the input to a flood inundation model (LisFlood-FP) which acknowledges uncertainty by utilising ten different sets of roughness coefficients identified using the same GLUE methodology. Likelihood measures for each parameter set computed on historical data are used to give uncertain predictions of flow hydrographs as well as spatial inundation extent. This analysis demonstrates that a full uncertainty analysis of such an integrated system is limited mainly by Computer power as well as by how well the rainfall predictions represent potential future conditions. However, these restrictions may be overcome or lessened in the future and this paper establishes a computationally feasible methodological approach to the uncertainty cascade problem.},

abstract = {The goal of this work is to comparatively evaluate the potential of both event-based automatic calibration and Dynamic Identifiability Analysis (DYNIA) as proposed by Wagener et al. This is combined with an investigation on a potential relation of a priori knowledge on event characteristics with optimal model parameters. A joint application of DYNIA and automatic parameter estimation leads to implications considering the informational content of both methods. Optimal model parameters, identified on an event basis, are tested for statistical relations with physical characteristics of the rainstorm events (e. g. intensity). In this paper, we present results of a modelling study in the Rietholzbach catchment (Switzerland). We employed the hydrological model WaSiM-ETH, using a combined DYNIA (Dynamic Identifiability Analysis) and automatic parameter estimation (PEST) approach to investigate best parameter sets as well as parameter variability along the time series of the hydrograph. The results of the study indicate that the ``drainage\{''\} parameter identifiability for the long-term simulation is linked to the event-based calibrated parameter for the flood events. However, the parameter sets obtained with single-event calibration could not be fully linked to the chosen characteristic features derived from the precipitation forecast.},

Good explanatory power of flood models requires a meaningful representation of bio-physical pro- cesses. Therefore great interest exists to improve the process representation. Progress in hydrolog- ical process understanding is achieved through a learning cycle including critical assessment of an existing model for a given catchment as a first step. The assessment will highlight deficiencies of the model, from which useful additional data require- ments are derived, giving a guideline for new mea- surements. These new measurements may in turn lead to improved process concepts. The improved process concepts are finally summarized in an up- dated hydrological model. In this thesis I demonstrate such a learning cy- cle, focusing on the advancement of model eval- uation methods and more cost effective measure- ments. For a successful model evaluation, I pro- pose that three questions should be answered: 1) when is a model reproducing observations in a satisfactory way? 2) If model results deviate, of what nature is the difference? And 3) what are most likely the relevant model components affect- ing these differences? To answer the first two ques- tions, I developed a new method to assess the tem- poral dynamics of model performance (or TIGER - TIme series of Grouped Errors). This method is powerful in highlighting recurrent patterns of in- sufficient model behaviour for long simulation pe- riods. I answered the third question with the anal- ysis of the temporal dynamics of parameter sensi- tivity (TEDPAS). For calculating TEDPAS, an ef- ficient method for sensitivity analysis is necessary. I used such an efficient method called Fourier Am- plitudeReusser, D. E. (2010). Combining smart model diagnostics and effective data collection for snow catchments. catchment as a case study, I found insufficient pro- cess descriptions for the snowdynamics and for the recession during dry periods in late summer and fall. Focusing on snow dynamics, reasons for poor model performance can either be a poor represen- tation of snow processes in the model, or poor data on snow cover, or both. To obtain an improved data set on snow cover, time series of snow height and temperatures were collected with a cost efficient method based on temperature measurements on multiple levels at each location. An algorithm was developed to si- multaneously estimate snow height and cold con- tent from these measurements. Both, snow height and cold content are relevant quantities for spring flood forecasting. Spatial variability was observed at the local and the catchment scale with an adjusted sampling de- sign. At the local scale, samples were collected on two perpendicular transects of 60 m length and analysed with geostatistical methods. The range determined from fitted theoretical variograms was within the range of the sampling design for 80\% of the plots. No patterns were found, that would ex- plain the random variability and spatial correlation at the local scale. At the watershed scale, locations of the exten- sive field campaign were selected according to a stratified sample design to capture the combined effects of elevation, aspect and land use. The snow height is mainly affected by the plot elevation. The expected influence of aspect and land use was not observed. To better understand the deficiencies of the snow module inWaSiM-ETH, the same approach, a sim- ple degree day model was checked for its capabil- ity to reproduce the data. The degree day model was capable to explain the temporal variability for plots with a continuous snow pack over the en- tire snow season, if parameters were estimated for single plots. However, processes described in the simple model are not sufficient to represent mul- tiple accumulation-melt-cycles, as observed for the lower catchment.},

abstract = {Assessing the time-varying sensitivity of environmental models has become a common approach to understand both the value of different data periods for estimating specific parameters, and as part of a diagnostic analysis of the model structure itself (i.e. whether dominant processes are emerging in the model at the right times and over the appropriate time periods). It is not straightforward to visualize these results though, given that the window size over which the time-varying sensitivity is best integrated generally varies for different parameters. In this short communication we present a new approach to visualizing such time-varying sensitivity across time scales of integration. As a case study, we estimate first order sensitivity indices with the FAST (Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test) method for a typical conceptual rainfall-runoff model. The resulting plots can guide data selection for model calibration, support diagnostic model evaluation and help to define the timing and length of spot gauging campaigns in places where long-term calibration data are not yet available.

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to evaluate the computational efficiency of fully coupled approaches for approximating a common class of nonlinear, two-phase advective–dispersive–reactive equations. The general problem considered includes homogeneous phase chemical kinetics, equilibrium interphase mass transfer, and rate-controlled interphase mass transfer––all of which may be nonlinear. Aspects of the problem investigated include discrete mass conservative formulations, temporal discretization approaches, and nonlinear equation solution methods. Their effect on computational efficiency is investigated through a series of numerical experiments using a nondimensional model problem. The effect of problem characteristics such as large sorption capacity, strong sorption nonlinearity, fast mass transfer, fast reactions, and strong diffusion is investigated. Comparisons of solution efficiency show that the optimal approach depends upon: (1) the characteristics of the problem considered, which may be described in a nondimensional form; and (2) the accuracy achieved in the solution. Results offer general guidance for selecting solution approaches for the class of problems investigated and introduce some new solution approaches to the water resources field that may be applicable to other problems.},

abstract = {<p>Parameter specification usually has significant influence on the performance of land surface models (LSMs). However, estimating the parameters properly is a challenging task due to the following reasons: (1) LSMs usually have too many adjustable parameters (20 to 100 or even more), leading to the curse of dimensionality in the parameter input space; (2) LSMs usually have many output variables involving water/energy/carbon cycles, so that calibrating LSMs is actually a multi-objective optimization problem; (3) Regional LSMs are expensive to run, while conventional multi-objective optimization methods need a large number of model runs (typically \~{}10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup>). It makes parameter optimization computationally prohibitive. An uncertainty quantification framework was developed to meet the aforementioned challenges, which include the following steps: (1) using parameter screening to reduce the number of adjustable parameters, (2) using surrogate models to emulate the responses of dynamic models to the variation of adjustable parameters, (3) using an adaptive strategy to improve the efficiency of surrogate modeling-based optimization; (4) using a weighting function to transfer multi-objective optimization to single-objective optimization. In this study, we demonstrate the uncertainty quantification framework on a single column application of a LSM – the Common Land Model (CoLM), and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. The result indicate that this framework can efficiently achieve optimal parameters in a more effective way. Moreover, this result implies the possibility of calibrating other large complex dynamic models, such as regional-scale LSMs, atmospheric models and climate models.</p>},

abstract = {There is increasing consensus in the hydrologic literature that an appropriate framework for streamflow forecasting and simulation should include explicit recognition of forcing and parameter and model structural error. This paper presents a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, entitled differential evolution adaptive Metropolis (DREAM), that is especially designed to efficiently estimate the posterior probability density function of hydrologic model parameters in complex, high-dimensional sampling problems. This MCMC scheme adaptively updates the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution during sampling and maintains detailed balance and ergodicity. It is then demonstrated how DREAM can be used to analyze forcing data error during watershed model calibration using a five-parameter rainfall-runoff model with streamflow data from two different catchments. Explicit treatment of precipitation error during hydrologic model calibration not only results in prediction uncertainty bounds that are more appropriate but also significantly alters the posterior distribution of the watershed model parameters. This has significant implications for regionalization studies. The approach also provides important new ways to estimate areal average watershed precipitation, information that is of utmost importance for testing hydrologic theory, diagnosing structural errors in models, and appropriately benchmarking rainfall measurement devices.},

@article{Zuazo2014b,
abstract = {Rainfall–runoff models are valuable tools to simulate the hydrologic response of a watershed. In recent years, Spatially Distributed Travel Time (SDTT) methods have been developed as an alternative to semi-distributed and distributed models. In these methods, the travel times of grid-cells are summed along flow paths and then convoluted to generate the hydrograph at the outlet. Some aspects of these models remain poorly understood, including the implications of different travel time formulations, the extent to which SDTT models take into account the interaction among cells, the effects of grid-cell resolution, and the validity of the kinematic wave (KW) assumptions in this context. In this study, we use an analytical approach as well as a SDTT model to investigate the significance of considering upstream contributions when calculating the travel times of cells and its influence on the computed time of concentration and overall hydrograph shape. We also analyze the effect of terrain resolution on the performance of SDTT models. Lastly, we study the validity of the KW assumptions when SDTT models are applied to a plane. Results show that considering upstream contributions when computing travel times yields much better results, increasing the modified coefficient of efficiency of the simulated hydrographs from 0.24 to 0.81 on the best case scenario. When using a travel time expression that neglects upstream contributions, finer grid cell sizes reduce the accuracy of the time of concentration and the simulated hydrograph, decreasing efficiency from 0.5 to −0.02 in the worst case scenario. Finally, the KW approximation applies to the plane irrespective of the grid-cell resolution when upstream contributions are considered in the SDTT model for a wide range of slopes and roughness coefficients.},

abstract = {State of the art models as used in activated sludge modelling and recently proposed for river water quality modelling integrate the knowledge in a certain field. If applied to data from a specific site, such models are nearly always overparameterised. This raises the question of how many parameters can be fitted in a given context and how to find identifiable parameter subsets given the experimental layout. This problem is addressed for the kinetic parameters of a simplified version of the recently published river water quality model no. 1 (RWQM1). The selection of practically identifiable parameter subsets is discussed for typical boundary conditions as a function of the measurement layout. Two methods for identifiable subset selection were applied and lead to nearly the same results. Assuming upstream and downstream measurements of dissolved substances to be available, only a few (5-8) model parameters appear to be identifiable. Extensive measurement campaigns with dedicated experiments seem to be required for successful calibration of RWQM1. The estimated prior uncertainties of the model parameters are used to estimate the uncertainty of model predictions. Finally an estimate is provided for the maximum possible decrease in prediction uncertainty achievable by a perfect determination of the values of the identifiable model parameters.},

In particular the way in which the colour in model residuals resulting from epistemic errors should be expected to be non-stationary means that it is difficult to justify the spin that the structure of residuals can be properly represented by statistical likelihood functions. To do so would be to greatly overestimate the information content in a set of calibration data and increase the possibility of both Type I and Type II errors. Some principles of trying to identify periods of disinformative data prior to evaluation of a model structure of interest, are discussed. An example demonstrates the effect on the estimated parameter values of a hydrological model.},

abstract = {This study presents quantitative and qualitative insights into the time scale dependencies of hydrological parameters, predictions and their uncertainties, and examines the impact of the time resolution of the calibration data on the identifiable system complexity. Data from an experimental basin (Weierbach, Luxembourg) is used to analyze four conceptual models of varying complexity, over time scales of 30 min to 3 days, using several combinations of numerical implementations and inference equations. Large spurious time scale trends arise in the parameter estimates when unreliable time-stepping approximations are employed and/or when the heteroscedasticity of the model residual errors is ignored. Conversely, the use of robust numerics and more adequate (albeit still clearly imperfect) likelihood functions markedly stabilizes and, in many cases, reduces the time scale dependencies and improves the identifiability of increasingly complex model structures. Parameters describing slow flow remained essentially constant over the range of subhourly to daily scales considered here, while parameters describing quick flow converged toward increasingly precise and stable estimates as the data resolution approached the characteristic time scale of these faster processes. These results are consistent with theoretical expectations based on numerical error analysis and data-averaging considerations. Additional diagnostics confirmed the improved ability of the more complex models to reproduce distinct signatures in the observed data. More broadly, this study provides insights into the information content of hydrological data and, by advocating careful attention to robust numericostatistical analysis and stringent process-oriented diagnostics, furthers the utilization of dense-resolution data and experimental insights to advance hypothesis-based hydrological modeling at the catchment scale.},

abstract = {This study investigates the possible correspondence between catchment structure, as represented by perceptual hydrological models developed from fieldwork investigations, and mathematical model structures, selected on the basis of reproducing observed catchment hydrographs. Three Luxembourgish headwater catchments are considered, where previous fieldwork suggested distinct flow-generating mechanisms and hydrological dynamics. A set of lumped conceptual model structures are hypothesized and implemented using the SUPERFLEX framework. Following parameter calibration, the model performance is examined in terms of predictive accuracy, quantification of uncertainty, and the ability to reproduce the flow-duration curve signature. Our key research question is whether differences in the performance of the conceptual model structures can be interpreted based on the dominant catchment processes suggested from fieldwork investigations. For example, we propose that the permeable bedrock and the presence of multiple aquifers in the Huewelerbach catchment may explain the superior performance of model structures with storage elements connected in parallel. Conversely, model structures with serial connections perform better in the Weierbach and Wollefsbach catchments, which are characterized by impermeable bedrock and dominated by lateral flow. The presence of threshold dynamics in the Weierbach and Wollefsbach catchments may favour nonlinear models, while the smoother dynamics of the larger Huewelerbach catchment were suitably reproduced by linear models. It is also shown how hydrologically distinct processes can be effectively described by the same mathematical model components. Major research questions are reviewed, including the correspondence between hydrological processes at different levels of scale and how best to synthesize the experimentalist's and modeller's perspectives.

abstract = {Computer models have become vital decision-making tools in many areas of science and engineering including water resources. However, models should be properly evaluated before use to improve the likelihood of making sound decisions based on their results. The model evaluation technique practiced today in hydrology assumes that model parameters are season insensitive and attempts to identify “optimal” values that would describe watershed behavior during dry and wet seasons. This assumption could compromise accuracy of model predictions. This study demonstrates performance improvement that would be achieved when a season-based model evaluation approach is pursued. A global sensitivity analysis (SA) model has been used to investigate seasonal sensitivity of streamflow parameters of a watershed simulation model on the headwaters of the Little River Watershed, one of the United States Department of Agriculture’s experimental watersheds.

These include Monte Carlo simulation, first-order second-moment analysis, point estimate method, logic tree analysis and first-order reliability method. Also presented is an overview of sensitivity analysis techniques that permit identification of those parameters that control the uncertainty in model predictions. These include stepwise regression, mutual information (entropy) analysis and classification tree analysis.

abstract = {Simulation modelling in ecology is a field that is becoming increasingly compartmentalized. Here we propose a Database Approach To Modelling (DATM) to create unity in dynamical ecosystem modelling with differential equations. In this approach the storage of ecological knowledge is independent of the language and platform in which the model will be run. To create an instance of the model, the information in the database is translated and augmented with the language and platform specifics. This process is automated so that a new instance can be created each time the database is updated. We describe the approach using the simple Lotka-Volterra model and the complex ecosystem model for shallow lakes PCLake, which we automatically implement in the frameworks OSIRIS, GRIND for MATLAB, ACSL, R, DUFLOW and DELWAQ. A clear advantage of working in a database is the overview it provides. The simplicity of the approach only adds to its elegance. © 2014 The Authors.},

@article{Freni2011a,
abstract = {Urban sources of water pollution have often been cited as the primary cause of poor water quality in receiving water bodies (RWB), and recently many studies have been conducted to investigate both continuous sources, such as wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, and intermittent sources, such as combined sewer overflows (CSOs). An urban drainage system must be considered jointly, i.e., by means of an integrated approach. However, although the benefits of an integrated approach have been widely demonstrated, several aspects have prevented its wide application, such as the scarcity of field data for not only the input and output variables but also parameters that govern intermediate stages of the system, which are useful for robust calibration. These factors, along with the high complexity level of the currently adopted approaches, introduce uncertainties in the modelling process that are not always identifiable. In this study, the identifiability analysis was applied to a complex integrated catchment: the Nocella basin (Italy). This system is characterised by two main urban areas served by two WWTPs and has a small river as the RWB. The system was simulated by employing an integrated model developed in previous studies. The main goal of the study was to assess the right number of parameters that can be estimated on the basis of data-source availability. A preliminary sensitivity analysis was undertaken to reduce the model parameters to the most sensitive ones. Subsequently, the identifiability analysis was carried out by progressively considering new data sources and assessing the added value provided by each of them. In the process, several identifiability methods were compared and some new techniques were proposed for reducing subjectivity of the analysis. The study showed the potential of the identifiability analysis for selecting the most relevant parameters in the model, thus allowing for model simplification, and in assessing the impact of data sources for model reliability, thus guiding the analyst in the design of future monitoring campaigns. Further, the analysis showed some critical points in integrated urban drainage modelling, such as the interaction between water quality processes on the catchment and in the sewer, that can prevent the identifiability of some of the related parameters.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between computer-based models and the environment they simulate is becoming increasingly important as we try to predict how the earth's climate will change. As a surrogate for the representation of uncertainty in a prediction problem, it is common to use the range of behaviour from a set of models ( an ensemble), and the ensemble mean as the 'best guess' prediction. We suggest a 'model space' metric, which, by providing one relevant definition of model independence, could allow us to begin to understand the relationship between model spread and prediction uncertainty. This in turn could allow the minimisation of bias from the inclusion of similar models in ensembles and quantification of how much independent information each model contributes to the prediction problem.},

abstract = {This study presents quantitative and qualitative insights into the time scale dependencies of hydrological parameters, predictions and their uncertainties, and examines the impact of the time resolution of the calibration data on the identifiable system complexity. Data from an experimental basin (Weierbach, Luxembourg) is used to analyze four conceptual models of varying complexity, over time scales of 30 min to 3 days, using several combinations of numerical implementations and inference equations. Large spurious time scale trends arise in the parameter estimates when unreliable time-stepping approximations are employed and/or when the heteroscedasticity of the model residual errors is ignored. Conversely, the use of robust numerics and more adequate (albeit still clearly imperfect) likelihood functions markedly stabilizes and, in many cases, reduces the time scale dependencies and improves the identifiability of increasingly complex model structures. Parameters describing slow flow remained essentially constant over the range of subhourly to daily scales considered here, while parameters describing quick flow converged toward increasingly precise and stable estimates as the data resolution approached the characteristic time scale of these faster processes. These results are consistent with theoretical expectations based on numerical error analysis and data-averaging considerations. Additional diagnostics confirmed the improved ability of the more complex models to reproduce distinct signatures in the observed data. More broadly, this study provides insights into the information content of hydrological data and, by advocating careful attention to robust numericostatistical analysis and stringent process-oriented diagnostics, furthers the utilization of dense-resolution data and experimental insights to advance hypothesis-based hydrological modeling at the catchment scale.},

@article{Soetaert2002b,
abstract = {A new, fortran-based, simulation environment called FEMME (Flexible Environment for Mathematically Modelling the Environment), designed for implementing, solving and analysing mathematical models in ecology is presented. Three separate phases in ecological modelling are distinguished: (1) the model formulation i.e. the choice and implementation of the constitutive relations of the mathematical model, (2) the choice of a numerical solution scheme and (3) the model application i.e. a particular run or set of runs of the model. The basic characteristic of FEMME is to keep these three phases independent. The software is structured in a highly modular fashion, allowing unlimited combination of each. The modeller can restrict attention mostly to the model formulation, while the numerical solution and model application can be specified at run time without programming effort. The object-oriented design strongly reduces redundancy in the code: the same set of solution procedures is linked to all models, and one model implementation can be used without extra coding in a variety of applications. FEMME contains many functional units, such as a diversity of integration routines, steady-state solvers, fitting routines, input and output facilities and allows running Monte Carlo or sensitivity analyses or performing food web analyses. The ease of interfacing model applications with external data facilitates running different scenarios or fitting the model to observations.},

abstract = {Conceptual hydrological modelling has under-utilised classical parameter analysis techniques (for both optimisation and uncertainty assessment) due to the prohibitively complicated nonsmooth geometry of typical parameter distributions. In the companion paper, a numerically robust model implementation framework was developed, based on stable time stepping schemes and careful threshold smoothing to eliminate the roughness of parameter surfaces. Here, this framework is exploited to enable parameter estimation using powerful and well-established techniques including: (i) Newton-type optimisation and (ii) principal-component-type (Hessian-based) uncertainty analysis. A case study using a representative rainfall-runoff-snow model illustrates the advantages of these previously unavailable methods, contrasting them with slower and less informative current approaches designed for nonsmooth functions. In addition to boosting the computational efficiency, the methods advocated in the paper yield more insight into improved model formulation and parameterisation (e.g., reducing model nonlinearity, detecting ill-conditioning and handling parameter multi-optimality). The impact of extreme model nonlinearity on model and parameter stability is also discussed, focusing on model identification aspects.},

abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter is the method of choice for many difficult high-dimensional filtering problems in meteorology, oceanography, hydrology and other fields. In this note we show that a common variant of the ensemble Kalman filter is an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) algorithm. This is of interest for a number of reasons. First, the ensemble Kalman filter is an example of an ABC algorithm that predates the development of ABC algorithms. Second, the ensemble Kalman filter is used for very high-dimensional problems, whereas ABC methods are normally applied only in very low-dimensional problems. Third, recent state of the art extensions of the ensemble Kalman filter can also be understood within the ABC framework.},

abstract = {Developing suitable dynamic models of biochemical pathways is a key issue in Systems Biology. Predictive models for cells or whole organisms could ultimately lead to model-based predictive and/or preventive medicine. Parameter estimation (i.e. model calibration) in these dynamic models is therefore a critical problem. In a recent contribution [Moles, C.G., Mendes, P., Banga, J.R., 2003b. Parameter estimation in biochemical pathways: a comparison of global optimisation methods. Genome Res. 13, 2467-2474], the challenging nature of such inverse problems was highlighted considering a benchmark problem, and concluding that only a certain type of stochastic global optimisation method, Evolution Strategies (ES), was able to solve it successfully, although at a rather large computational cost. In this new contribution, we present a new integrated optimisation methodology with a number of very significant improvements: (i) computation time is reduced by one order of magnitude by means of a hybrid method which increases efficiency while guaranteeing robustness, (ii) measurement noise (errors) and partial observations are handled adequately, (iii) automatic testing of identifiability of the model (both local and practical) is included and (iv) the information content of the experiments is evaluated via the Fisher information matrix, with subsequent application to design of new optimal experiments through dynamic optimisation.},

There is at present a general lack of consistency in the way in which hydrological models are assessed that handicaps the comparison of reported studies and hinders the development of superior models. The HydroTest web site provides a wide range of objective metrics and consistent tests of model performance to assess forecasting skill. This resource is designed to promote future transparency and consistency between reported models and includes an open forum that is intended to encourage further discussion and debate on the topic of hydrological performance evaluation metrics. It is envisaged that the provision of such facilities will lead to the creation of superior forecasting metrics and the development of international benchmark time series datasets.

annote = {Many existing hydrological modelling procedures do not make best use of available information, resulting in non-minimal uncertainties in model structure and parameters, and a lack of detailed information regarding model behaviour. A framework is required that balances the level of model complexity supported by the available data with the level of performance suitable for the desired application. Tools are needed that make optimal use of the information available in the data to identify model structure and parameters, and that allow a detailed analysis of model behaviour. This should result in appropriate levels of model complexity as a function of available data, hydrological system characteristics and modelling purpose. This paper introduces an analytical framework to achieve this, and tools to use within it, based on a multi-objective approach to model calibration and analysis. The utility of the framework is demonstrated with an example from the field of rainfall-runoff modelling.},

abstract = {Analysing the properties of a biological system through in silico experimentation requires a satisfactory mathematical representation of the system including accurate values of the model parameters. Fortunately, modern experimental techniques allow obtaining time-series data of appropriate quality which may then be used to estimate unknown parameters. However, in many cases, a subset of those parameters may not be uniquely estimated, independently of the experimental data available or the numerical techniques used for estimation. This lack of identifiability is related to the structure of the model, i.e. the system dynamics plus the observation function. Despite the interest in knowing a priori whether there is any chance of uniquely estimating all model unknown parameters, the structural identifiability analysis for general non-linear dynamic models is still an open question. There is no method amenable to every model, thus at some point we have to face the selection of one of the possibilities. This work presents a critical comparison of the currently available techniques. To this end, we perform the structural identifiability analysis of a collection of biological models. The results reveal that the generating series approach, in combination with identifiability tableaus, offers the most advantageous compromise among range of applicability, computational complexity and information provided.},

abstract = {A literature review of freshwater model ecosystem studies with herbicides was performed 1) to assess the NOECecosystem for individual compounds, 2) to compare these threshold levels with water quality standards, and 3) to evaluate the ecological consequences of exceeding these standards. Studies were judged appropriate for this purpose when 1) the test systems simulated a realistic freshwater community, 2) the experimental design was generally sound (ANOVA or regression design; exposure concentrations described) and 3) when published in 1980 and later. Almost half of the collected papers did not meet these selection criteria. Effects were classified according to their magnitude and duration. The most sensitive endpoints for photosynthesis inhibitors, the most widely studied group of herbicides, were responses related to community metabolism and the structure of phytoplankton, periphyton and macrophytes. These endpoints showed a clear dose-response relationship. The criteria as set by the Uniform Principles appeared to provide sufficient protection for aquatic ecosystems against herbicides. Possible exceptions are the herbicides with an auxin-simulating mode of action, because aquatic macrophytes appeared to be more sensitive to these substances than algae. Functional responses of communities in phytoplankton-dominated ecosystems sometimes recovered rapidly through shifts in algae species composition and adaptation. Indirect effects on the zooplankton in such systems generally occurred at higher concentrations than primary effects. Adequate studies in macrophyte-dominated systems were rare, but in several experiments a pronounced long-term decline of macrophytes was observed at chronic concentrations only slightly above the NOECecosystem. This may result in considerable indirect effects on the macrophyte-associated fauna. The most important modifying factors with respect to types of effects and recovery rates following the application of herbicides to freshwater ecosystems are also discussed.},

abstract = {Uncertainty in hydrometric data is a fact of life. Basic assumptions about the nature of this uncertainty are necessary in every analysis of hydrometric data, and an understanding of the variability of uncertainty can facilitate the effective use of hydrologic information. For most of the twentieth century there has been little change in hydrometric methods and many analysts explicitly or implicitly assume that the uncertainty has not changed over the period of record. We argue that there is substantial variability in the magnitude of uncertainty in published streamflow records that is not transparent to data users. Quantifying uncertainty is particularly important in the context of the current changes in hydrometric technology and in the increasing integration of data sets from multiple providers. We recommend best practices for identifying uncertainty in field notes and propagating that observational uncertainty through the data production process. We suggest both field and reanalysis studies that could be undertaken to improve understanding of hydrometric uncertainty. We also recommend improvements in management practices, including preservation of relevant metadata and a suitable period of overlap for new and old observing systems to allow assessment of the effects of changing technology.},

abstract = {Hydrological models have to be calibrated accurately to provide reasonable model results. For a concise model evaluation, the different phases of the hydrograph have to be considered in multi-metric frameworks with appropriate performance metrics. Low and high flows need to be reproduced simultaneously without neglecting the other phases of the hydrograph. In this paper, we highlight the relevance of very low and low flows with separate performance metrics. We present a multi-metric evaluation framework to identify calibration runs, which represent the different phases of the hydrograph precisely. A stepwise evaluation was done with commonly used statistical performance metrics (Nash-Sutcliffe, percent bias) and signature metrics, which are based on the flow duration curve (FDC). In order to consider a fairly balanced evaluation between high and low flow phases, we divided the flow duration curve into segments of high, medium and low flow phases, and additionally into very high and very low flow phases. The model performance in these segments was evaluated separately with the root mean square error (RMSE). Our results show that this evaluation method leads to an improved selection of good calibration runs to enhance the overall model performance by the refined segmentation of FDC. By combining performance metrics for high flow conditions with low flow conditions, this study demonstrates the challenge of calibrating a model with a satisfactory performance in high and low phases simultaneously. Consequently, we conclude that an additional performance metric for very low flows should be included in model analyzes to improve the overall performance in all phases of the hydrograph.

abstract = {A new approach is presented applicable in framework of model calibration to observed data. The approach consists of a combination of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation technique (GLUE) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). The method is based on multiple model evaluations. The GSA is a quantitative, model independent approach and is based on estimating the fractional contribution of each input factor to the variance of the model output, also accounting for interaction terms. In GLUE, the model runs are classified according to a likelihood measure, conditioning each run to observations. In calibration procedures, strong interaction is observed between model parameters, due to model over-parameterization. The use of likelihood measures allows an estimate of the posterior joint pdf of parameters. By performing a GSA to the likelihood measure, input factors mainly driving model runs with good fit to data are identified. Moreover GSA allows highlighting the basic features of the interaction structure. Any other tool subsequently adopted to represent in more detail the interaction structure, from correlation coefficients to Principal Component Analysis to Bayesian networks to tree-structured density estimation, confirms the general features identified by GSA.},

Many R-R models are used merely for research purposes in order to enhance the knowledge and understanding about the hydrological processes that govern a real world system. Other types of models are developed and employed as tools for simulation and prediction aiming ultimately to allow decision makers to take the most effective decision for planning and operation while considering the interactions of physical, ecological, economic, and social aspects of a real world system.},

abstract = {The Regionalized Sensitivity Analysis (RSA) was developed in 1978, for identifying critical unknown processes in poorly defined systems, thus directing the focus of further scientific investigations. Here, we demonstrate its application to model structure identification, by ranking the constituent hypotheses and identifying the critical elements for progressive revision of the model. Our case study is Lake Oglethorpe - a small monomictic impoundment in South-eastern Georgia, USA. Recent studies indicate that the warm temperate regional climate affords an extended growing season - typically from March to October - which promotes bacterial productivity in the lake. The result is a summer food web dominated by microbial processes, in contrast to the conventional phytoplankton-dominated food chains typically observed in the cold temperate lakes of Europe and North America. Starting with a simple phytoplankton-based food web model and a qualitative definition of system behaviour, we use the RSA procedure to establish the critical role of bacteria-mediated decomposition in Lake Oglethorpe, thus justifying the inclusion of microbial processes. Further analysis reveals the importance of size-dependent selective consumption of phytoplankton and bacteria. Finally, we discuss important practical implications of this novel application of the RSA regarding sampling efficiency and statistical robustness.},

The potentials of this simple and versatile graphical tool are discussed. Beyond the qualitative assessment provided by this approach, a statistical test is proposed for sensitivity analysis. A case study that simulates the transport of radionuclides through the geosphere from an underground disposal vault containing nuclear waste is considered as a benchmark. The new approach is tested against a very efficient sensitivity analysis method based on state dependent parameter meta-modelling.},

abstract = {This study seeks to identify sensitivity tools that will advance our understanding of lumped hydrologic models for the purposes of model improvement, calibration efficiency and improved measurement schemes. Four sensitivity analysis methods were tested: (1) local analysis using parameter estimation software (PEST), (2) regional sensitivity analysis (RSA), (3) analysis of variance (ANOVA), and (4) Sobol's method. The methods' relative efficiencies and effectiveness have been analyzed and compared. These four sensitivity methods were applied to the lumped Sacramento soil moisture accounting model (SAC-SMA) coupled with SNOW-17. Results from this study characterize model sensitivities for two medium sized watersheds within the Juniata River Basin in Pennsylvania, USA. Comparative results for the 4 sensitivity methods are presented for a 3-year time series with 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h time intervals. The results of this study show that model parameter sensitivities are heavily impacted by the choice of analysis method as well as the model time interval. Differences between the two adjacent watersheds also suggest strong influences of local physical characteristics on the sensitivity methods' results. This study also contributes a comprehensive assessment of the repeatability, robustness, efficiency, and ease-of-implementation of the four sensitivity methods. Overall ANOVA and Sobol's method were shown to be superior to RSA and PEST. Relative to one another, ANOVA has reduced computational requirements and Sobol's method yielded more robust sensitivity rankings.},

abstract = {Research investigated the robustness of Monte Carlo techniques when applied to pesticide fate models. Work focused on predictions for leaching of a hypothetical pesticide to groundwater using the PELMO model. The robustness of the Monte Carlo approach was estimated by i) repeating the probabilistic modelling 10 times using different seed numbers (the seed number is used to initiate the generation of random sequences) for various number of model runs; and ii) assessing the dependence of Monte Carlo results on small variations in the procedures for parameterising statistical distributions for Koc and DT50. Monte Carlo results were found to be inherently variable (CV 5 to 211\% for 10 replicates) even when a relatively large number of model runs (5000) were undertaken. Results were also found to be affected by slight changes in the parameterisation of probability density functions and in the assignment of correlation between parameters. The levels of variability reported have the potential to affect regulatory decisions. The findings suggest that extreme care should be exercised when undertaking Monte Carlo modelling or assessing the results of probabilistic modelling.},

@article{Sadegh2013b,
abstract = {In recent years, a strong debate has emerged in the hydrologic literature regarding how to properly treat nontraditional error residual distributions and quantify parameter and predictive uncertainty. Particularly, there is strong disagreement whether such uncertainty framework should have its roots within a proper statistical (Bayesian) context using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques, or whether such a framework should be based on a quite different philosophy and implement informal likelihood functions and simplistic search methods to summarize parameter and predictive distributions. This paper is a follow-up of our previous work published in Vrugt and Sadegh (2013) and demonstrates that approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) bridges the gap between formal and informal statistical model-data fitting approaches. The ABC methodology has recently emerged in the fields of biology and population genetics and relaxes the need for an explicit likelihood function in favor of one or multiple different summary statistics that measure the distance of each model simulation to the data. This paper further studies the theoretical and numerical equivalence of formal and informal Bayesian approaches using discharge and forcing data from different watersheds in the United States, in particular generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE). We demonstrate that the limits of acceptability approach of GLUE is a special variant of ABC if each discharge observation of the calibration data set is used as a summary diagnostic.},

abstract = {The presented work is part of a larger research program dealing with developing tools for coupling biogeochemical models in contaminated landscapes. The specific objective of this article is to provide researchers with a data porting tool to build hexagonal raster using information from a rectangular raster data (e.g. GIS format). This tool involves a computational algorithm and an open source software (written in C). The method of extending the reticulated functions defined on 2D networks is an essential key of this algorithm and can also be used for other purposes than data porting. The algorithm allows one to build the hexagonal raster with a cell size independent from the geometry of the rectangular raster. The extended function is a bi-cubic spline which can exactly reconstruct polynomials up to degree three in each variable. We validate the method by analyzing errors in some theoretical case studies followed by other studies with real terrain elevation data. We also introduce and briefly present an iterative water routing method and use it for validation on a case with concrete terrain data.},

abstract = {Observation uncertainty is nowadays recognized as a serious issue undermining the reliability of hydrological studies. For instance, many recent contributions show that river flow observations are affected by errors that may reach 25\% even when state-of-the-art measurement techniques are adopted. Yet, there is still little guidance by the literature on the most appropriate modelling strategies to be adopted under observation uncertainty. We carried out a series of simulation experiments and explored how the selection of appropriate model complexity can help reduce the impact of observation uncertainty. We found that model structure plays a relevant role and, in particular, a description of the relevant physical processes that come into play can effectively contribute to limit the impact of data errors and therefore significantly reduce overall uncertainty.

abstract = {Onvolledige of foutieve neerslaggegevens zijn een belangrijke oorzaak van onzekerheid in het hydrologisch modelleren van een stroomgebied, voornamelijk in regio's met sterke ruimtelijke variabiliteit zoals in de tropen. Fouten in metingen van neerslag zijn onvermijdelijk en de slechte ruimtelijke resolutie van de neerslagstations in deze gebieden maakt het extra moeilijk om deze variabiliteit correct op te meten. In (semi)ruimtelijk verdeelde modellen is een correct begrip van de ruimtelijke variabiliteit van de neerslag nochtans noodzakelijk om voordelen ten opzichte van lumped modellen te verkrijgen, namelijk het inzicht in de interne hydrologische processen van het stroomgebied. Interpolatietechnieken zijn een middel om ruimtelijke schattingen te verkrijgen in plaats van puntschattingen. Nochtans zijn discontinuteiten in klimatologische gegevens moeilijk volledig te beschrijven. Vele methoden zijn voorhanden, met ondermeer de algemeen gebruikte Thiessen polygonen, de Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) en de kriging methoden. In dit werk zijn interpolaties van de neerslag uitgevoerd met Thiessen polygonen, IDW en ordinary kriging. De mogelijkheid om de hoogteligging mee op te nemen werd nagegaan. Vermits geen duidelijk verband tussen de hoogteligging en de neerslag kon worden aangetoond is dit niet verder uitgewerkt. Het semi-ruimtelijk verdeelde model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) is toegepast om de invloed van interpolatietechnieken op de modellering van de hydrologie van het Nzoia stroomgebied in Kenia te veri eren. De neerslaginput in SWAT vertoont sterke simpli caties waarbij voor elk deelbekken de neerslag wordt overgenomen van het dichtst bijzijnde station. Hierdoor worden bepaalde stations buiten beschouwing gelaten wat een verlies aan informatie iii Hoofdstuk 0. Samenvatting iv betekent. Een bijkomend probleem is de onvolledigheid van de neerslaggegevens afkomstig van het Metereologisch Instituut van Kenia. Bovenstaande twee problemen worden grotendeels omzeild door het toepassen van de opgestelde interpolatietechnieken. De interpolatietechnieken rekenen dagelijks met alle beschikbare stations, waardoor alle beschikbare informatie wordt gebruikt. Vermits per dag enkel met de beschikbare gegevens wordt gewerkt, is het niet noodzakelijk de ontbrekende data vooraf aan te vullen. De neerslag wordt opnieuw uitgemiddeld per deelbekken zodat de neerslag kan worden toegekend aan de deelbekkens via virtuele stations, gelegen op de centroden van de subbasins. Een initiele autokalibratie werd uitgevoerd met de oorspronkelijke input van de meetstations. In een eerste fase werden de bekomen parameters gebruikt bij de modellering met de gegenereerde neerslaginput, waarbij geen opmerkelijke verbetering in de modelresultaten werd gevonden. In een tweede fase werd een nieuwe autokalibratie uitgevoerd met de gegenereerde neerslaginput, waardoor een e ectieve verbeterde simulatie van de debietmetingen kon worden vastgesteld, wat het potentieel aangeeft van het gebruik van verbeterde invoer van neerslag voor het SWAT model, hoewel het onderlinge onderscheid tussen de technieken beperkt blijft.},

abstract = {Uncertainty of model output predictions is an often neglected but very important aspect of modelling. Moreover, the need for a unified approach to quantify this uncertainty arose recently in the field of wastewater treatment plant modelling. In this thesis, a rigorous methodology to quantify output uncertainty resulting from different uncertainty sources is developed. The proposed tool consists of following consequent steps: parameter selection (based on local sensitivity analysis), parameter estimation (with local Simplex optimisation), parameter estimate confidence interval determination (with the Nelder-and-Mead method based on the Hessian matrix) and uncertainty propagation to the model output (by means of Monte Carlo simulations). The developed tool was tested on a complex biosystem model, i.e. the full-scale Eindhoven wastewater treatment plant model, in order to investigate the impact of data frequency and model structure on output uncertainty. The tool revealed to be useful in the determination of the impact of data frequency on the model output i.e. when less calibration and/or input data are fed to the model, parameter estimates deviate more from the default values, parameter estimate confidence intervals become wider and output uncertainty boundaries exhibit the same trend. The impact of different model structures could not be determined for the case tested (using three different aeration models). Moreover, it is believed that this is also attributed to the fact that the procedure is only tested under stable, dry weather conditions. It is expected that differences between a simple and a more realistic and extended aeration model would appear when the procedure is executed under varying conditions. However, some bottlenecks in the procedure still need to be cured, of which the most important one seems to be the coupling of the parameter estimate confidence intervals with the uncertainty propagation. Indeed, it was found that these confidence intervals are still quite small and are expected to be larger as predicted output uncertainty is very small. When the observed problems are solved, which seems realistically feasible, the proposed procedure could be a good step in the direction of a well-defined, scientifically based and still practical methodology to quantify output uncertainty resulting from different uncertainty sources. Indeed, the procedure is relatively easy to handle and can determine output uncertainties resulting from different uncertainty sources, even for complex biosystem models. In the end this should lead to more reliable models for WWTP with significantly reduced calibration effort. viii},

abstract = {We used both time domain (deuterium) and source area (alkalinity) tracers to reduce uncertainty in simple conceptual rainfall-runoff models applied to a larger (749 km(2)) heterogeneous catchment with both upland and lowland headwaters. Stepwise, tracer-aided model development resulted in different model structures for the uplands and lowlands as representative elementary watersheds (REWs). These were differentiated by the parameterization of a nonlinear overland flow mechanism in the former, and the incorporation of high soil moisture storage capacity in the latter. Use of tracers and recession characteristics also helped to reduce parameter uncertainty and provided models that could simulate flows and tracer responses reasonably well over a full hydrological year. However, it was apparent that other processes (e.g., more complex mixing, fractionation, etc.) would need to be parameterized to explain the full variation in isotope dynamics. It is also evident that the information content of tracer data declines as the intensity of sampling decreases, particularly in the lowlands. The models of the REWs were coupled to provide plausible simulations of the up-scaled flow and tracer response at the outfall of the 749 km(2) catchment, though the usefulness of source area tracers decreased markedly at this larger scale. Whereas the approach provides a step toward simple models that are likely to give the "right answer for the right reasons,'' further improvements appear to require increased parameterization and/or higher-resolution tracer data.},

@article{DeLannoy2014b,
abstract = {Uncertainties in L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiative transfer modeling (RTM) affect the simulation of brightness temperatures (Tb) over land and the inversion of satellite-observed Tb into soil moisture retrievals. In particular, accurate estimates of the microwave soil roughness, vegetation optical depth and scattering albedo for large-scale applications are difficult to obtain from field studies and often lack an estimate of uncertainty. Here, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation method is used to determine satellite-scale estimates of RTM parameters and their posterior uncertainty by minimizing the misfit between long-term averages and standard deviations of simulated and observed Tb at multiple incidence angles, at horizontal and vertical polarizations, and for morning and evening overpasses. Tb simulations are generated with the land model component of the Goddard Earth Observing System (version 5) and confronted with Tb observations from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity satellite mission. The maximum a posteriori density (MAP) parameter values reduce the root-mean-square differences between observed and simulated long-term Tb averages and standard deviations to 3.4 K and 23 K, respectively. The relative uncertainty of the posterior RTM parameter estimates is typically less than 25\% of the MAP parameter value, whereas it exceeds 100\% for literature-based prior parameter estimates. It is also shown that the parameter values estimated through Particle Swarm Optimization are in close agreement with those obtained from MCMC simulation. The MCMC results for the RTM parameter values and the uncertainties presented herein are directly relevant to the need for accurate Tb modeling in global land data assimilation systems.

abstract = {While many scientific studies show the influence of agricultural landscape patterns on water cycle and water quality, only a few of these have proposed scientifically based and operational methods to improve water management. Territ'eau is a framework developed to adapt agricultural landscapes to water quality protection, using components such as farmers' fields, seminatural areas, and human infrastructures, which can act as sources, sinks, or buffers on water quality. This framework allows us to delimit active areas contributing to water quality, defined by the following three characteristics: (i) the dominant hydrological processes and their flow pathways, (ii) the characteristics of each considered pollutant, and (iii) the main landscape features. These areas are delineated by analyzing the flow connectivity from the stream to the croplands, by assessing the buffer functions of seminatural areas according to their flow pathways. Hence, this framework allows us to identify functional seminatural areas in terms of water quality and assess their limits and functions; it helps in proposing different approaches for changing agricultural landscape, acting on agricultural practices or systems, and/or conserving or rebuilding seminatural areas in controversial landscapes. Finally, it allows us to objectivize the functions of the landscape components, for adapting these components to new environmental constraints.},

abstract = {The aim of this contribution is partly to build consensus on a consistent modelling methodology (CMM) of complex real processes in wastewater treatment by combining classical concepts with results from applied mathematics, and partly to apply it to the clarification-thickening process in the secondary settling tank. In the CMM, the real process should be approximated by a mathematical model (process model; ordinary or partial differential equation (ODE or PDE)), which in turn is approximated by a simulation model (numerical method) implemented on a computer. These steps have often not been carried out in a correct way. The secondary settling tank was chosen as a case since this is one of the most complex processes in a wastewater treatment plant and simulation models developed decades ago have no guarantee of satisfying fundamental mathematical and physical properties. Nevertheless, such methods are still used in commercial tools to date. This particularly becomes of interest as the state-of-the-art practice is moving towards plant-wide modelling. Then all submodels interact and errors propagate through the model and severely hamper any calibration effort and, hence, the predictive purpose of the model. The CMM is described by applying it first to a simple conversion process in the biological reactor yielding an ODE solver, and then to the solid-liquid separation in the secondary settling tank, yielding a PDE solver. Time has come to incorporate established mathematical techniques into environmental engineering, and wastewater treatment modelling in particular, and to use proven reliable and consistent simulation models.},

abstract = {A rainfall–runoff model is normally applied to storm events outside of the range of conditions in which it has been successfully calibrated and verified. This investigation examined the uncertainty of model output caused by model calibration parameters. Four methods, the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), Latin hypercube simulation (LHS), Rosenblueth's point estimation method (RPEM), and Harr's point estimation method (HPEM), were utilized to build uncertainty bounds on an estimated hydrograph. Comparing these four methods indicates that LHS produces analytical results similar to those of MCS. According to our results, the LHS only needs 10\% of the number of MCS parameters to achieve similar performance. However, the analysis results from RPEM and HPEM differ markedly from those from MCS due to the very small number of model parameters.},

abstract = {The detailed evaluation of mathematical models and the consideration of uncertainty in the modeling of hydrological and environmental systems are of increasing importance, and are sometimes even demanded by decision makers. At the same time, the growing complexity of models to represent real-world systems makes it more and more difficult to understand model behavior, sensitivities and uncertainties. The Monte Carlo Analysis Toolbox (MCAT) is a Matlab library of visual and numerical analysis tools for the evaluation of hydrological and environmental models. Input to the MCAT is the result of a Monte Carlo or population evolution based sampling of the parameter space of the model structure under investigation. The MCAT can be used off-line, i.e. it does not have to be connected to the evaluated model, and can thus be used for any model for which an appropriate sampling can be performed. The MCAT contains tools for the evaluation of performance, identifiability, sensitivity, predictive uncertainty and also allows for the testing of hypotheses with respect to the model structure used. In addition to research applications, the MCAT can be used as a teaching tool in courses that include the use of mathematical models.},

abstract = {This comment is a response to the criticisms of the GLUE methodology by [Mantovan, P., Todini, E., 2006. Hydrological forecasting uncertainty assessment: Incoherence of the GLUE methodology, J. Hydrology, 2006]. In this comment it is shown that the formal Bayesian identification of models is a special case of GLUE that can be used where the modeller is prepared to make very strong assumptions about the nature of the modelling errors. For the hypothetical study of Mantovan and Todini, exact assumptions were assumed known for the formal Bayesian identification, but were then ignored in the application of GLUE to the same data. We show that a more reasonable application of GLUE to this problem using similar prior knowledge shows that gives equally coherent results to the formal Bayes identification. In real applications, subject to input and model structural error it is suggested that the coherency condition of MT06 cannot hold at the single observation Level and that the choice of a formal Bayesian likelihood function may then be incoherent. In these (more interesting) cases, GLUE can be coherent in the application of likelihood measures based on blocks of data, but different choices of measures and blocks effectively represent different beliefs about the information content of data in real applications with input and model structural errors.

abstract = {The probability-distributed principle in basin-scale hydrology considers the frequency of occurrence of hydrological variables (model inputs, parameters or elements) of certain magnitudes over the basin without regard to the location of a particular occurrence within the basin. The random assemblage of different parts is considered more important than the relation of the parts, one to another. Rainfall-runoff models based on probability-distributed infiltration capacity and storage capacity concepts, and which generate runoff according to Hortonian and saturation overland flow mechanisms respectively, are distinguished. Two types of probability-distributed storage capacity model are identified, one based on an assumption that storage elements at points in the basin respond independently of their neighbours, and the other where storage elements interact so as to equalize the depth of stored water over the basin. Allowing redistribution of water leads to simplification of the model equations. The probability-distributed principle is also used to represent the process of water translation through the basin. Interpretation of the instantaneous unit hydrograph as a probability density function of translation time is demonstrated and the inverse Gaussian density proposed as a suitable functional form on physical grounds.

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) is a commonly used approach for identifying important parameters that dominate model behaviors. We use a newly developed software package, a Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of ten widely used SA methods, including seven qualitative and three quantitative ones. All SA methods are tested using a variety of sampling techniques to screen out the most sensitive (i.e., important) parameters from the insensitive ones. The Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model, which has thirteen tunable parameters, is used for illustration. The South Branch Potomac River basin near Springfield, West Virginia in the U.S. is chosen as the study area. The key findings from this study are: (1) For qualitative SA methods, Correlation Analysis (CA), Regression Analysis (RA), and Gaussian Process (GP) screening methods are shown to be not effective in this example. Morris One-At-a-Time (MOAT) screening is the most efficient, needing only 280 samples to identify the most important parameters, but it is the least robust method. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Delta Test (DT) and Sum-Of-Trees (SOT) screening methods need about 400–600 samples for the same purpose. Monte Carlo (MC), Orthogonal Array (OA) and Orthogonal Array based Latin Hypercube (OALH) are appropriate sampling techniques for them; (2) For quantitative SA methods, at least 2777 samples are needed for Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) to identity parameter main effect. McKay method needs about 360 samples to evaluate the main effect, more than 1000 samples to assess the two-way interaction effect. OALH and LP$\tau$ (LPTAU) sampling techniques are more appropriate for McKay method. For the Sobol' method, the minimum samples needed are 1050 to compute the first-order and total sensitivity indices correctly. These comparisons show that qualitative SA methods are more efficient but less accurate and robust than quantitative ones.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the practices, the problems, and the prospects of hydrological modeling based on geographic information systems (GIS). The authors argue that current stand-alone and various loose/tight coupling approaches for integrating GIS with hydrological modeling are essentially technology-driven without adequately addressing the conceptual problems involved in the integration. The conceptualizations of space and time embedded in the current generation of GIS are not conceptually compatible with those in the hydrological models. This incompatibility implicitly imposes constraints on the type of hydrological models that can be developed. By reframing the future research agenda from the emerging geographic information science (GIScience) perspective, the authors contend that the integration of hydrological modeling with GIS should proceed with the development of a high-level common ontology that is compatible with both GIS and hydrological models. The new ontological scheme should incorporate alternative conceptualizations of space and time capable of handling cross-scale linkages of hydrological processes. The emerging interoperable paradigm should be the core strategy for the implementation of the new framework. This paper also calls for more research to better handle and communicate the uncertainties in the process of GIScience-based hydrological modeling. GIScience-based hydrological modeling will not only espouse new computational models and implementation strategies that are computing-platform-independent but also liberate us from the constraints of existing hydrological models and the rigid spatial–temporal framework embedded in the current generation of GIS, and enable us to advance hydrological sciences, develop more versatile GIS technologies, and seek innovative applications relevant to societal concerns. ©},

After reviewing the fundamentals of vector optimization theory and the algorithmic issues, we link the multi-criteria calibration approach with the concepts of uncertainty and equifinality. Specifically, the multi-criteria framework enables recognition and handling of errors and uncertainties, and detection of prominent behavioural solutions with acceptable trade-offs. Particularly in models of complex parameterization, a multi-objective approach becomes essential for improving the identifiability of parameters and augmenting the information contained in calibration by means of both multi-response measurements and empirical metrics ("soft" data), which account for the hydrological expertise. Based on the literature review, we also provide alternative techniques for dealing with conflicting and non-commeasurable criteria, and hybrid strategies to utilize the information gained towards identifying promising compromise solutions that ensure consistent and reliable calibrations.},

abstract = {The environmental modeller faces a dilemma. Science often demands that more and more process representations are incorporated into models (particularly to avoid the possibility of making missing process errors in predicting future response). Testing the causal representations in environmental models (as multiple working hypotheses about the functioning of environmental systems) then depends on specifying boundary conditions and model parameters adequately. This will always be difficult in applications to a real system because of the heterogeneities, non-stationarities, complexities and epistemic uncertainties inherent in environmental prediction. Thus, it can be difficult to define the information content of a data set used in model evaluation and any consequent measures of belief or verisimilitude. A limit of acceptability approach to model evaluation is suggested as a way of testing models, implying that thought is required to define critical experiments that will allow models as hypotheses to be adequately differentiated.

@article{Belia2009,
abstract = {This paper serves as a problem statement of the issues surrounding uncertainty in wastewater treatment modelling. The paper proposes a structure for identifying the sources of uncertainty introduced during each step of an engineering project concerned with model-based design or optimisation of a wastewater treatment system. It briefly references the methods currently used to evaluate prediction accuracy and uncertainty and discusses the relevance of uncertainty evaluations in model applications. The paper aims to raise awareness and initiate a comprehensive discussion among professionals on model prediction accuracy and uncertainty issues. It also aims to identify future research needs. Ultimately the goal of such a discussion would be to generate transparent and objective methods of explicitly evaluating the reliability of model results, before they are implemented in an engineering decision-making context.},

annote = {This paper considers distributed hydrological models in hydrology as an expression of a pragmatic realism. Some of the problems of distributed modelling are discussed including the problem of nonlinearity, the problem of scale, the problem of equifinality, the problem of uniqueness and the problem of uncertainty. A structure for the application of distributed modelling is suggested based on an uncertain or fuzzy landscape space to model space mapping. This is suggested as the basis for an Alternative Blueprint for distributed modelling in the form of an application methodology. This Alternative Blueprint is scientific in that it allows for the formulation of testable hypotheses. It focuses attention on the prior evaluation of models in terms of physical realism and on the value of data in model rejection. Finally, some unresolved questions that distributed modelling must address in the future are outlined, together with a vision for distributed modelling as a means of learning about places.},

abstract = {Simulation of rainfall-runoff process in urban areas is of great importance considering the consequences and damages of extreme runoff events and floods. The first issue in flood hazard analysis is rainfall simulation. Large scale climate signals have been proved to be effective in rainfall simulation and prediction. In this study, an integrated scheme is developed for rainfall-runoff modeling considering different sources of uncertainty. This scheme includes three main steps of rainfall forecasting, rainfall-runoff simulation and future runoff prediction. In the first step, data driven models are developed and used to forecast rainfall using large scale climate signals as rainfall predictors. Due to high effect of different sources of uncertainty on the output of hydrologic models, in the second step uncertainty associated with input data, model parameters and model structure is incorporated in rainfall-runoff modeling and simulation. Three rainfall-runoff simulation models are developed for consideration of model conceptual (structural) uncertainty in real time runoff forecasting. To analyze the uncertainty of the model structure, streamflows generated by alternative rainfall-runoff models are combined, through developing a weighting method based on K-means clustering. Model parameters and input uncertainty are investigated using an adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Finally, calibrated rainfall-runoff models are driven using the forecasted rainfall to predict future runoff for the watershed. The proposed scheme is employed in the case study of the Bronx River watershed, New York City. Results of uncertainty analysis of rainfall-runoff modeling reveal that simultaneous estimation of model parameters and input uncertainty significantly changes the probability distribution of the model parameters. It is also observed that by combining the outputs of the hydrological models using the proposed clustering scheme, the accuracy of runoff simulation in the watershed is remarkably improved up to 50\% in comparison to the simulations by the individual models. Results indicate that the developed methodology not only provides reliable tools for rainfall and runoff modeling, but also adequate time for incorporating required mitigation measures in dealing with potentially extreme runoff events and flood hazard. Results of this study can be used in identification of the main factors affecting flood hazard analysis.},

@article{Dumedah2014d,
abstract = {Assessment of uncertainty in land surface models is complex, mainly because of the numerous sources of error from model parameters, initial states, input forcing data, and the model structure. These sources of uncertainty interact together to impact the simulated output generated from the land surface model. To account for these uncertainties, the goal in diagnostic model evaluation has been to determine the erroneous/inadequate components of the model structure that need improvement. However, the specification of inaccurate model components is not straightforward, requiring crucial steps to determine the uncertainty contributions from individual error sources. Also, the interaction between the uncertainty sources makes it difficult to assess the impact of the individual error sources on the simulated output. The approach undertaken in this study was to quantify the specific uncertainties linked with model parameters, states, input forcing variables, and spatial variations in landscape properties, such that the remaining model uncertainty is equivalent to the inadequacy/inaccuracy associated with the model structure. This study employed the Evolutionary Data Assimilation, together with multi-dimensional clustering, to quantify these individual uncertainties for the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model, in terms of soil moisture estimation for the Yanco area in south-east Australia. The findings showed that the updated soil moisture was more accurate than both the open loop and calibrated estimates. The minimum uncertainty for model components was found to reduce the original and updated bounds by 68\% and 62\% respectively. The estimated model pathway has accurately reproduced the updated estimates with less than 0.02m3/m3 error, and was found to be more accurate than both the calibrated and the updated estimates when evaluated against in-situ soil moisture.},

@article{Montanari2005,
abstract = {[1] Several methods have been recently proposed for quantifying the uncertainty of hydrological models. These techniques are based upon different hypotheses, are diverse in nature, and produce outputs that can significantly differ in some cases. One of the favored methods for uncertainty assessment in rainfall-runoff modeling is the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE). However, some fundamental questions related to its application remain unresolved. One such question is that GLUE relies on some explicit and implicit assumptions, and it is not fully clear how these may affect the uncertainty estimation when referring to large samples of data. The purpose of this study is to address this issue by assessing how GLUE performs in detecting uncertainty in the simulation of long series of synthetic river flows. The study aims to ( 1) discuss the hypotheses underlying GLUE and derive indications about their effects on the uncertainty estimation, and ( 2) compare the GLUE prediction limits with a large sample of data that is to be simulated in the presence of known sources of uncertainty. The analysis shows that the prediction limits provided by GLUE do not necessarily include a percentage close to their confidence level of the observed data. In fact, in all the experiments, GLUE underestimates the total uncertainty of the simulation provided by the hydrological model.},

@article{Nott2012,
abstract = {There has been a recent debate in the hydrological community about the relative merits of the informal generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) approach to uncertainty assessment in hydrological modeling versus formal probabilistic approaches. Some recent literature has suggested that the methods can give similar results in practice when properly applied. In this note, we show that the connection between formal Bayes and GLUE is not merely operational but goes deeper, with GLUE corresponding to a certain approximate Bayesian procedure even when the "generalized likelihood" is not a true likelihood. The connection we describe relates to recent approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods originating in genetics. ABC algorithms involve the use of a kernel function, and the generalized likelihood in GLUE can be thought of as relating to this kernel function rather than to the model likelihood. Two interpretations of GLUE emerge, one as a computational approximation to a Bayes procedure for a certain "error-free" model and the second as an exact Bayes procedure for a perturbation of that model in which the truncation of the generalized likelihood in GLUE plays a role. The intent of this study is to encourage cross-fertilization of ideas regarding GLUE and ABC in hydrologic applications. The connection we outline suggests the possibility of combining a formal likelihood with a kernel based on a generalized likelihood within the ABC framework and also allows advanced ABC computational methods to be used in GLUE applications. The model-based interpretation of GLUE may also be helpful in partially illuminating the implicit assumptions in different choices of generalized likelihood. Citation: Nott, D. J., L.

abstract = {Sensitivity analyses are valuable tools for identifying important model parameters, testing the model conceptualization, and improving the model structure. They help to apply the model efficiently and to enable a focussed planning of future research and field measurement. Two different methods were used for sensitivity analyses of the complex process-oriented model TACD (tracer aided catchment model, distributed) that was applied to the meso-scale Brugga basin (40 km2) and the sub-basin St Wilhelmer Talbach (15.2 km2). Five simulations periods were investigated: two summer events, two snow melt induced events and one summer low flow period. The model was applied using 400 different parameter sets, which were generated by Monte Carlo simulations using latin hypercube sampling. The regional sensitivity analysis (RSA) allowed determining the most significant parameters for the complete simulation periods using a graphical method. The results of the regression-based sensitivity analysis were more detailed and complex. The temporal variability of the simulation sensitivity could be observed continuously and the significance of the parameters could be determined in a quantitative way. A dependency of the simulation sensitivity on initial- and boundary conditions and the temporal and spatial variability of the sensitivity to some model parameters was revealed by the regression-based sensitivity analysis. Thus, the difficulty of transferring the results to different time periods or model applications in other catchments became obvious. The analysis of the temporal course of the simulation sensitivity to parameter values in conjunction with simulated and measured additional data sets (precipitation, temperature, reservoir volumes etc.) gave further insight into the internal model behaviour and demonstrated the plausibility of the model structure and process conceptionalizations.},

abstract = {Using a conceptual hydraulic model, a one-dimensional dynamic river water quality model has been developed to assess the short-term fate of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) in the river compartments water and benthic sediment. The model assumes local equilibrium sorption and that both dissolved and sorbed chemical are available for biodegradation. To investigate the interaction of nutrient dynamics and organic contaminant fate, the model is coupled with a basic water quality model. On the basis of the Lambro River (Italy) as a case study, the result shows that the model predictions agree well with the measured data set. The model output sensitivity to model parameters has been tested, and the results depict that the model is highly sensitive to the biodegrading parameters. Also, a comparison of a steady state with a dynamic simulation and the effect of nutrient dynamics on the LAS fate in the Lambro River as a scenario analysis are presented. The results indicate the usefulness of the proposed model for the short-term simulation of organic contaminant fate in unsteady environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Conceptual hydrological modelling has traditionally been plagued by calibration difficulties due to the roughness and complex shape of objective functions. These problems led to the abandonment of powerful classical analysis methods (Newton-type optimisation, derivative-based uncertainty analysis) and have motivated extensive research into nonsmooth optimisation and even new parameter estimation philosophies (e.g. GLUE). This paper shows that some of these complexities are not inherent features of hydrological models, but are numerical artefacts due to model thresholds and poorly selected time stepping schemes. We present a numerically robust methodology for implementing conceptual models, including rainfall-runoff and snow models, that ensures micro-scale smoothness of objective functions and guarantees macro-scale model stability. The methodology employs robust and unconditionally stable time integration of the models, complemented by careful threshold smoothing. A case study demonstrates the benefits of these techniques.},

abstract = {The COST/IWA Benchmark Simulation Model No 1 (BSM1) has been available for almost a decade. Its primary purpose has been to create a platform for control strategy benchmarking of activated sludge processes. The fact that the research work related to the benchmark simulation models has resulted in more than 300 publications worldwide demonstrates the interest in and need of such tools within the research community. Recent efforts within the IWA Task Group on "Benchmarking of control strategies for WWTPs" have focused on an extension of the benchmark simulation model. This extension aims at facilitating control strategy development and performance evaluation at a plant-wide level and, consequently, includes both pretreatment of wastewater as well as the processes describing sludge treatment. The motivation for the extension is the increasing interest and need to operate and control wastewater treatment systems not only at an individual process level but also on a plant-wide basis. To facilitate the changes, the evaluation period has been extended to one year. A prolonged evaluation period allows for long-term control strategies to be assessed and enables the use of control handles that cannot be evaluated in a realistic fashion in the one week BSM1 evaluation period. In this paper, the finalised plant layout is summarised and, as was done for BSM1, a default control strategy is proposed. A demonstration of how BSM2 can be used to evaluate control strategies is also given.},

As an example application, 72 variants of a single soil moisture accounting store are tested as simplified hypotheses of runoff generation at six experimental grassland field-scale lysimeters through model rejection and a novel diagnostic scheme. The fields, designed as replicates, exhibit different hydrological behaviors which yield different model performances. For fields with low initial discharge levels at the beginning of events, the conceptual stores considered reach their limit of applicability. Conversely, one of the fields yielding more discharge than the others, but having larger data gaps, allows for greater flexibility in the choice of model structures. As a model learning exercise, the study points to a "leaking" of the fields not evident from previous field experiments. It is discussed how understanding observational uncertainties and incorporating these into model diagnostics can help appreciate the scale of model structural error.},

abstract = {A literature review of freshwater model ecosystem studies with insecticides was performed 1) to assess the NOECecosystem for individual compounds, 2) to compare these threshold levels with water quality standards and 3) to evaluate the ecological consequences of exceeding these standards. Studies were judged appropriate for this purpose when 1) the test systems simulated a realistic freshwater community, 2) the experimental design was generally sound (ANOVA or regression design; exposure concentrations described) and 3) when published in 1980 and later. Most studies dealt with organophosphates (predominantly single applications) and synthetic pyrethroids (mostly repeated applications) in standing waters. Structural endpoints were more sensitive than functional ones. The most sensitive taxa were representatives of the crustaceans, insects and fish. Most studies tested relatively high concentrations, with even lowest concentrations showing effects. A NOECeco could therefore be established for a limited number of compounds only. Based on toxic units, safe threshold values were more or less the same for compounds with a similar mode of action. This also accounted for the nature and magnitude of direct effects at higher concentrations. Usually, indirect effects were reported at higher concentrations than those for direct effects. Although laboratory single species toxicity tests may not allow predictions on (exact) ecological effects, some generalisations on direct effects and recovery can be made with respect to the acute EC50 Safe concentrations, as set for water quality standards, appear to be protective. Depending on exposure regime, the NOECeco is generally in the range of (0.1-0.01) x EC50 standard test species. Recovery of sensitive endpoints usually takes place within two months after the last application when peak concentrations stay lower than (0.1-1) x EC50 sensitive standard test species. of the most sensitive standard test species. of the most sensitive of the most},

The robust Bayesian approach makes it possible to consider ambiguity in this prior knowledge. Describing such ambiguity using sets of probability distributions defined by the Density Ratio Class has important conceptual advantages over alternative robust formulations. Earlier studies showed that the Density Ratio Class is invariant under Bayesian inference and marginalization. We prove that (i) the Density Ratio Class is also invariant under propagation through deterministic models, whereas (ii) predictions of a stochastic model with parameters defined by a Density Ratio Class are embedded in a Density Ratio Class. These invariance properties make it possible to describe sequential learning and prediction under a unified framework. We developed numerical algorithms to minimize the additional computational burden relative to the use of single priors. Practical feasibility of these methods is demonstrated by their application to a simple ecological model.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method for rainfall-runoff model calibration and performance analysis in the wavelet-domain by fitting the estimated wavelet-power spectrum (a representation of the time-varying frequency content of a time series) of a simulated discharge series to the one of the corresponding observed time series. As discussed in this paper, calibrating hydrological models so as to reproduce the time-varying frequency content of the observed signal can lead to different results than parameter estimation in the time-domain. Therefore, wavelet-domain parameter estimation has the potential to give new insights into model performance and to reveal model structural deficiencies. We apply the proposed method to synthetic case studies and a real-world discharge modeling case study and discuss how model diagnosis can benefit from an analysis in the wavelet-domain. The results show that for the real-world case study of precipitation - runoff modeling for a high alpine catchment, the calibrated discharge simulation captures the dynamics of the observed time series better than the results obtained through calibration in the time-domain. In addition, the wavelet-domain performance assessment of this case study highlights the frequencies that are not well reproduced by the model, which gives specific indications about how to improve the model structure.},

@article{SMITH2008,
abstract = {Within hydrology performance criteria such as the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency have been used to condition the parameter space of a model. Their use is motivated by the fact that the stochastic error series between a model output and corresponding observations is the result of the composite effect of multiple error sources which cannot be described, even in form, a priori. This paper formalises the use of such performance criteria within a Bayesian framework, such as Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE), by introducing the concept of informal Likelihoods. Informal Likelihoods are used to characterise desirable features in the relationship between the model output and corresponding observed data. A number of common performance criteria are considered as Informal Likelihoods. Analytical results and a simulation indicate all of the performance criteria considered as Informal Likelihoods in this paper have one or more properties which may be considered undesirable, but may perform no less well in conditioning model parameters than formal likelihoods for which the assumptions are only mildly incorrect.

abstract = {The proposed methodology allows for the identification of time and space scales to be satisfied for the development of a parsimonious rainfall-runoff model. The maximum acceptable time step (MATS) is first determined so that the dynamical hydrological response of the basin can be properly represented. A characteristic time of the basin hydrological response is used therefore. The MATS allows next to estimate the maximum acceptable space scale with respect to the geostatistical properties of the precipitation cumulated over the MATS. As a result, it is possible to define if the basin can be represented for the MATS by a lumped hydrological model or if not, the minimum number of sub-basins needed for a reasonable representation of the precipitation spatial variability.},

@article{McMillan2012a,
abstract = {This review and commentary sets out the need for authoritative and concise information on the expected error distributions and magnitudes in observational data. We discuss the necessary components of a benchmark of dominant data uncertainties and the recent developments in hydrology which increase the need for such guidance. We initiate the creation of a catalogue of accessible information on characteristics of data uncertainty for the key hydrological variables of rainfall, river discharge and water quality (suspended solids, phosphorus and nitrogen). This includes demonstration of how uncertainties can be quantified, summarizing current knowledge and the standard quantitative results available. In particular, synthesis of results from multiple studies allows conclusions to be drawn on factors which control the magnitude of data uncertainty and hence improves provision of prior guidance on those uncertainties. Rainfall uncertainties were found to be driven by spatial scale, whereas river discharge uncertainty was dominated by flow condition and gauging method. Water quality variables presented a more complex picture with many component errors. For all variables, it was easy to find examples where relative error magnitudes exceeded 40\%. We consider how data uncertainties impact on the interpretation of catchment dynamics, model regionalization and model evaluation. In closing the review, we make recommendations for future research priorities in quantifying data uncertainty and highlight the need for an improved culture of engagement with observational uncertainties.

abstract = {This article provides an extended response to the criticisms of the GLUE methodology by Mantovan and Todini [Mantovan, P., Todini, E., 2006. Hydrological forecasting uncertainty assessment: incoherence of the GLUE methodology. J. Hydrol. 330, 368-381]. It is shown that the formal Bayesian identification of models is a special case of GLUE that can be used where the modeller is prepared to make very strong assumptions about the nature of the modelling errors. Under such assumptions, GLUE can be coherent in the sense of Manotvan and Todini. In real applications, however, with multiple sources of uncertainty including model structural error, their strong definition of coherence is shown to be inapplicable to the extent that the choice of a format likelihood function based on a simple error structure may be an incoherent choice. It is demonstrated by some relatively minor modifications of their hypothetical example that misspecification of the error model and the non-stationarities associated with the presence of input error and model structural error in the Bayes approach will then produce well-defined but incorrect parameter distributions. This empirical result is quite independent of GLUE, but the flexibility of the GLUE approach may then prove to be an advantage in providing more coherent and robust choices of model evaluation in these cases and, by analogy, in other non-ideal cases for real applications. At the current time it is difficult to make a reasoned choice between methods of uncertainty estimation for real applications because of a lack of understanding of the real information content of data in conditioning models.

abstract = {[1] The goal of model identification is to improve our understanding of the structure and behavior of a system so the model can be used to make inferences about its input-state-output response. It is conventional to preselect some model form and evaluate its "suitability" against historical data. If deemed unsuitable, ways must be found to "correct" the model through some intuitive process. Here, we discuss a Bayesian data assimilation process by which historical observations can be used to diagnose what might be wrong with the presumed mathematical structure of the model and to provide guidance toward fixing the problem. In previous work we showed how, given a suitable conceptual model for the system, the Bayesian estimation of structure (BESt) method can estimate the stochastic form for structural equations of a model that are consistent with historical observations at the spatiotemporal scale of the data while explicitly estimating model structural contributions to prediction uncertainty. However, a prior assumption regarding the form of the equations (an existing model) is often available. Here, we extend BESt to show how the mathematical form of the prior model equations can be corrected/improved to be more consistent with available data while remaining consistent with the presumed physics of the system. Conditions under which convergence will occur are stated. The potential of the extended BESt approach is demonstrated in the context of basin-scale hydrological modeling by correcting the equations of the HyMod model applied to the Leaf River catchment and thereby improving its representation of system input-state-output response.},

abstract = {Uncertainty analysis in integrated urban drainage modelling is of growing importance in the field of water quality. However, only few studies deal with uncertainty quantification in urban drainage modelling; furthermore, the few existing studies mainly focus on quantitative sewer flow modelling rather than uncertainty in water quality aspects. In this context, the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology was applied for the evaluation of the uncertainty of an integrated urban drainage model and some of its subjective hypotheses have been explored. More specifically, the influence of the subjective choice of the acceptability threshold has been detected in order to gain insights regarding its effect on the model results. The model has been applied to the Savena case study (Bologna, Italy) where water quality and quantity data were available. The model results show a strong influence of the acceptability threshold selection and confirm the importance of modeller's experience in the application of GLUE uncertainty analysis.},

Due to this upgrade, biostability increased, less chlorination was needed and drinking water quality improved significantly. The aim of this study was to describe the full-scale reactor with a limited set of equations. In order to describe the ozonation process, a model including key processes such as ozone decomposition, organic carbon removal, disinfection and bromate formation was developed. Kinetics were implemented in WEST® and simulation results were compared to real data. The predicting performance was verified with a goodness-of-fit test and key parameters were determined through a local sensitivity analysis. Parameters involving optical density (both rate constants and stoichiometric coefficients) strongly affect model output. Some parameters with respect to bromate and bacteria showed to be only, but to a large extent, sensitive to their associated concentrations. A scenario analysis was performed to study the system's behavior at different operational conditions. It was demonstrated that the model is able to describe the operation of the full-scale ozone reactor, however, further data collection for model validation is necessary.},

abstract = {Approaches to predictions in ungauged basins have so far mainly focused on a priori parameter estimates from physical watershed characteristics or on the regionalization of model parameters. Recent studies suggest that the regionalization of hydrologic indices (e.g., streamflow characteristics) provides an additional way to extrapolate information about the expected watershed response to ungauged locations for use in continuous watershed modeling. This study contributes a novel multiobjective framework for identifying behavioral parameter ensembles for ungauged basins using suites of regionalized hydrologic indices. The new formulation enables the use of multiobjective optimization algorithms for the identification of model ensembles for predictions in ungauged basins for the first time. Application of the new formulation to 30 watersheds located in England and Wales and comparison of the results with a Monte Carlo approach demonstrate that the new formulation will significantly advance our ability to reduce the uncertainty of predictions in ungauged basins.},

abstract = {Numerical solver uncertainty is high when the solutions of the differential equations of a model, computed with different numerical solvers, deviate from each other. Numerical solver uncertainty is a serious limiting factor of the simulation process and can lead to incorrect model predictions. This problem is especially critical because the correct solution trajectory of environmental models, often consisting of large systems of ODEs, is almost always unknown. The selection of the most appropriate solver, according to speed and correctness, is not a straightforward task and cannot be based on, for instance, literature. Moreover, with the advent of distributed computing, large amounts of data on previously run simulations are readily available. Analyzing these data can help automating the selection of the most appropriate solver. A new methodology for this automatic selection, based on the correctness of the solution from a repository of simulations, was developed and tested on a set of 16 models with different levels of complexity. This methodology is capable of finding deviating solutions when the model is computed with different solvers and settings, and shows that numerical solver uncertainty is quite common. A cluster of appropriate solvers, which are able to solve the model correctly, can be identified and the most efficient solver can be selected among them. This results in a reduction of the numerical solver uncertainty. On top of that, it was also possible to achieve a reduction of the computation time by a factor of 10(6), compared to slow, but undoubtedly correct solvers.},

@article{Vrugt2013b,
abstract = {The ever increasing pace of computational power, along with continued advances in measurement technologies and improvements in process understanding has stimulated the development of increasingly complex hydrologic models that simulate soil moisture flow, groundwater recharge, surface runoff, root water uptake, and river discharge at different spatial and temporal scales. Reconciling these high-order system models with perpetually larger volumes of field data is becoming more and more difficult, particularly because classical likelihood-based fitting methods lack the power to detect and pinpoint deficiencies in the model structure. Gupta et al. (2008) has recently proposed steps (amongst others) toward the development of a more robust and powerful method of model evaluation. Their diagnostic approach uses signature behaviors and patterns observed in the input-output data to illuminate to what degree a representation of the real world has been adequately achieved and how the model should be improved for the purpose of learning and scientific discovery. In this paper, we introduce approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) as a vehicle for diagnostic model evaluation. This statistical methodology relaxes the need for an explicit likelihood function in favor of one or multiple different summary statistics rooted in hydrologic theory that together have a clearer and more compelling diagnostic power than some average measure of the size of the error residuals. Two illustrative case studies are used to demonstrate that ABC is relatively easy to implement, and readily employs signature based indices to analyze and pinpoint which part of the model is malfunctioning and in need of further improvement.},

abstract = {The focus in the search for more reliable predictions in ungauged basins (PUB) has generally been on reducing uncertainty in watershed models (mainly their parameters). More recently, however, we seem to remember that the ultimate objective is not to define the parameters of a specific model but to understand the watershed: What behavior do we expect the ungauged watershed to exhibit? And what behavior should not occur in a particular ungauged watershed? The answers to these questions actually provide additional information that can be assimilated in watershed models for uncertainty reduction in PUB. This extension to hydrologic modeling approaches provides a quantitative link between watershed modeling and statistical hydrology as well as process hydrology that has to be explored. We witness a convergence of approaches-Bayesian, set theoretic, and optimization based-toward utilizing this link. The result is an opportunity for the (quantitative) dialog between modelers, statistical hydrologists, and experimentalists. We close our discussion of this development by presenting new and exciting research questions that we now have to address.},

abstract = {Na een eerste zoektocht in de literatuur in het kader van ‘onzekerheid bij hydrologisch modelleren’ bleek reeds dat we te maken hadden met een levendig onderwerp binnen de hydrologie dat een sterke aandacht geniet en zich nog in volle evolutie bevindt. Dit hoeft niet te verbazen aangezien de complexiteit van de onzekerheidsanalyse, door het grote aantal invloeden die erop inspelen, groot is. We hebben immers te maken met “... unknown errors in input and boundary conditions that get processed nonlinearly through a model that has structural errors and which is then compared with observations that have unknown measurement and commensurability error characteristics”. [Beven, 2006] We hebben dan ook getracht in dit projectwerk een overzicht te geven van de belangrijkste modelleringconcepten en definities, gevolgd door een bespreking van de verschillende oorzaken van de onzekerheid, dit vooral toegespitst op neerslag-afvoermodellen. Aangezien er op dit moment tientallen frameworks bestaan voor het inschatten van onzekerheid, waarbij binnen elk framework nog een groot aantal variaties kunnen voorkomen, hebben we hier geenszins getracht een overzicht te geven, laat staan een volledig. We hebben ons hierbij beperkt tot drie voorbeelden, waarvan de GLUE-methode de meest bekende is. Tot slot geven we nog een uiteenzetting over de toekomstperspectieven van onzekerheidsanalyses.},

abstract = {River discharge is typically derived from a single valued stage-discharge relationship. However, the relationship is affected by different sources of uncertainty, especially, in the measurement of discharge and stage values. The measurement uncertainty propagates into stage-discharge relationship curve and affects the discharge values derived from the relation. A fuzzy set theory based methodology is investigated in this paper for the analysis of uncertainty in the stage-discharge relationship. Individual components of stage and discharge measurement are considered as a fuzzy numbers and the overall stage and discharge uncertainty is obtained through the aggregation of all uncertainties using fuzzy arithmetic. Building on the previous work—fuzzy discharge and stage measurements, we use fuzzy nonlinear regression—in this case study for the analysis of uncertainty in the stage-discharge relationship. The methodology is based on fuzzy extension principle and considers input and output variables as well as th...},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mathematical modelling of biological systems is becoming a standard approach to investigate complex dynamic, non-linear interaction mechanisms in cellular processes. However, models may comprise non-identifiable parameters which cannot be unambiguously determined. Non-identifiability manifests itself in functionally related parameters, which are difficult to detect. RESULTS: We present the method of mean optimal transformations, a non-parametric bootstrap-based algorithm for identifiability testing, capable of identifying linear and non-linear relations of arbitrarily many parameters, regardless of model size or complexity. This is performed with use of optimal transformations, estimated using the alternating conditional expectation algorithm (ACE). An initial guess or prior knowledge concerning the underlying relation of the parameters is not required. Independent, and hence identifiable parameters are determined as well. The quality of data at disposal is included in our approach, i.e. the non-linear model is fitted to data and estimated parameter values are investigated with respect to functional relations. We exemplify our approach on a realistic dynamical model and demonstrate that the variability of estimated parameter values decreases from 81 to 1\% after detection and fixation of structural non-identifiabilities.},

abstract = {The quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration method can asymptotically provide a rate of convergence O(N1), while the rate of convergence of the standard Monte Carlo (MC) method is only O(N1/2). For a sufficiently large number of sampled points N, QMC should always outperform MC. However, for high dimen- sional problems such a large number of points can be infeasible. Many numerical experiments demonstrated that the advantages of QMC integration can disappear for high-dimensional problems. At the same time there are high-dimensional problems for which QMC significantly outperforms MC. Using global sensitivity indices the classification of some important classes of integrable functions is developed. It can be used for the prediction of the QMC efficiency. It is shown that the superiority of QMC over MC depends on the importance of higher-order terms in the ANOVA decomposition of an integrand. Results of numerical tests verify the prediction of the developed technique.},

abstract = {The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the incoherence, in terms of Bayesian inference, of the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) approach, introduced by Beven and Bintey in 1992. This results into a reduced capacity of the technique to extract information, in other words to "learn", from observations. The paper also discusses the implications of this reduced Learning capacity for parameter estimation and hydrological forecasting uncertainty assessment, which has led to the definition of the "equifinality" principle. The notions of coherence for learning and prediction processes as well as the value of a statistical experiment are introduced. These concepts are useful in showing that the GLUE methodology defines a statistical inference process, which is inconsistent and incoherent. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Robson2014b,
abstract = {This article considers how aquatic systems modelling has changed since 1995 and how it must change in future if we are to continue to advance. A distinction is made between mechanistic and statistical models, and the relative merits of each are considered. The question of “when do aquatic systems models provide accurate and useful predictions?” is addressed, implying some guidelines for model development. It is proposed that, in general, ecological models only provide management-relevant predictions of the behaviour of real systems when there are strong physical (as opposed to chemical or ecological) drivers. Developments over the past 15 years have included changes in technology, changes in the modelling community and changes in the context in which modelling is conducted: the implications of each are briefly discussed. Current trends include increased uptake of best practice guidelines, increasing integration of models, operationalisation, data assimilation, development of improved tools for skill assessment, and application of models to new management questions and in new social contexts. Deeper merging of statistical and mechanistic modelling approaches through such techniques as Bayesian Melding, Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling and surrogate modelling is identified as a key emerging area. Finally, it is suggested that there is a need to systematically identify areas in which our current models are inadequate. We do not yet know for which categories of problems well-implemented aquatic systems models can (or cannot) be expected to accurately predict observational data and system behaviour. This can be addressed through better modelling and publishing practices.},

abstract = {Given the structural shortcomings of conceptual rainfall-runoff models and the common use of time-invariant model parameters, these parameters can be expected to represent broader aspects of the rainfall-runoff relationship than merely the static catchment characteristics that they are commonly supposed to quantify. In this article, we relax the common assumption of time-invariance of parameters, and instead seek signature information about the dynamics of model behaviour and performance. We do this by using a temporal clustering approach to identify periods of hydrological similarity, allowing the model parameters to vary over the clusters found in this manner, and calibrating these parameters simultaneously. The diagnostic information inferred from these calibration results, based on the patterns in the parameter sets of the various clusters, is used to enhance the model structure. This approach shows how diagnostic model evaluation can be used to combine information from the data and the functioning of the hydrological model in a useful manner.

A lack of objective approaches to evaluate model structures and the inability of calibration procedures to distinguish between the suitability of different parameter sets are major sources of uncertainty in current modelling procedures. This paper presents an approach analysing the performance of the model in a dynamic fashion resulting in an improved use of available information. Model structures can be evaluated with respect to the failure of individual components, and periods of high information content for specific parameters can be identified. The procedure is termed dynamic identifiability analysis (DYNIA) and is applied to a model structure built from typical conceptual components. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The problems of calibrating soil hydraulic and transport parameters are well documented, particularly when data are limited. Programs such as CXTFIT, UUCODE and PEST, based on well established principles of statistical inference, will often provide good fits to limited observations giving the impression that a useful model of a particular soil system has been obtained. This may be the case, but such an approach may grossly underestimate the uncertainties associated with future predictions of the system and resulting dependent variables. In this paper, this is illustrated by an application of CXTFIT within the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) approach to model calibration which is based on a quite different philosophy. CXTFIT gives very good fits to the observed breakthrough curves for several different model formulations, resulting in very small parameter uncertainty estimates. The application of GLUE, however, shows that much wider ranges of parameter values can provide acceptable fits to the data. The wider range of potential outcomes should be more robust in model prediction, especially when used to constrain field scale models. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Checking for model identifiability has several advantages as outlined in the paper. We illustrate the use of several screening methods for assessing structural identifiability that should serve as a valuable precursor to model redesign and more sophisticated uncertainty analyses. These are: global evolutionary optimisation algorithms (EAs) that are being used increasingly to estimate parameters of models because of their flexibility; one and two dimensional discrete model response plots with the latter showing trajectories of convergence/non-convergence; quadratic response surface approximations; and sensitivity analysis of combinations of parameters using Polynomial Chaos Expansion model emulation. Each method has a role to play in understanding the nature of non-identifiability. We illustrate the utility and complementary value of these methods for conceptual rainfall-runoff processes with real and ‘exact’ daily flow data, hydrological models of increasing complexity, and different objective functions. We conclude that errors in data are not primarily the cause of the parameter identification problem and objective function selection gives only a partial solution. Model structure reveals itself to be a major problem for the two more complex models examined, as characterised by the dotty/1D, 2D projection and eigen plots. The Polynomial Chaos Expansion method helps reveal which interactions between parameters could affect the model identifiability. Structural non-identifiability is seen to pervade even at modest levels of model complexity.},

@article{Freni2011,
abstract = {Urban sources of water pollution have often been cited as the primary cause of poor water quality in receiving water bodies (RWB), and recently many studies have been conducted to investigate both continuous sources, such as wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, and intermittent sources, such as combined sewer overflows (CSOs). An urban drainage system must be considered jointly, i.e., by means of an integrated approach. However, although the benefits of an integrated approach have been widely demonstrated, several aspects have prevented its wide application, such as the scarcity of field data for not only the input and output variables but also parameters that govern intermediate stages of the system, which are useful for robust calibration. These factors, along with the high complexity level of the currently adopted approaches, introduce uncertainties in the modelling process that are not always identifiable. In this study, the identifiability analysis was applied to a complex integrated catchment: the Nocella basin (Italy). This system is characterised by two main urban areas served by two WWTPs and has a small river as the RWB. The system was simulated by employing an integrated model developed in previous studies. The main goal of the study was to assess the right number of parameters that can be estimated on the basis of data-source availability. A preliminary sensitivity analysis was undertaken to reduce the model parameters to the most sensitive ones. Subsequently, the identifiability analysis was carried out by progressively considering new data sources and assessing the added value provided by each of them. In the process, several identifiability methods were compared and some new techniques were proposed for reducing subjectivity of the analysis. The study showed the potential of the identifiability analysis for selecting the most relevant parameters in the model, thus allowing for model simplification, and in assessing the impact of data sources for model reliability, thus guiding the analyst in the design of future monitoring campaigns. Further, the analysis showed some critical points in integrated urban drainage modelling, such as the interaction between water quality processes on the catchment and in the sewer, that can prevent the identifiability of some of the related parameters.},

The paper aims to raise awareness and initiate a comprehensive discussion among professionals on model prediction accuracy and uncertainty issues. It also aims to identify future research needs.

However, only few studies deal with uncertainty quantification in urban drainage modelling; furthermore, the few existing studies mainly focus on quantitative sewer flow modelling rather than uncertainty in water quality aspects. In this context, the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology was applied for the evaluation of the uncertainty of an integrated urban drainage model and some of its subjective hypotheses have been explored. More specifically, the influence of the subjective choice of the acceptability threshold has been detected in order to gain insights regarding its effect on the model results. The model has been applied to the Savena case study (Bologna, Italy) where water quality and quantity data were available. The model results show a strong influence of the acceptability threshold selection and confirm the importance of modeller's experience in the application of GLUE uncertainty analysis.},

abstract = {The trend to move towards continuous production processes in pharmaceutical applications enhances the necessity to develop mechanistic models to understand and control these processes. This work focuses on the drying behaviour of a single wet granule before tabletting, using a six-segmented fluidised bed drying system, which is part of a fully continuous from-powder-to-tablet manufacturing line. The drying model is based on a model described by Mezhericher et al. [1] and consists of two submodels. In the first drying phase (submodel 1), the surface water evaporates, while in the second drying phase (submodel 2), the water inside the granule evaporates. The second submodel contains an empirical power coefficient, $\beta$. A sensitivity analysis was performed to study the influence of parameters on the moisture content of single pharmaceutical granules, which clearly points towards the importance of $\beta$ on the drying behaviour.

abstract = {The trend to move towards continuous production processes in pharmaceutical applications enhances the necessity to develop mechanistic models to understand and control these processes. This work focuses on the drying behaviour of a single wet granule before tabletting, using a six-segmented fluidised bed drying system, which is part of a fully continuous from-powder-to-tablet manufacturing line. The drying model is based on a model described by Mezhericher et al. [1] and consists of two submodels. In the first drying phase (submodel 1), the surface water evaporates, while in the second drying phase (submodel 2), the water inside the granule evaporates. The second submodel contains an empirical power coefficient, $\beta$. A sensitivity analysis was performed to study the influence of parameters on the moisture content of single pharmaceutical granules, which clearly points towards the importance of $\beta$ on the drying behaviour. Experimental data with the six-segmented fluidised bed dryer were collected to calibrate $\beta$. An exponential dependence on the drying air temperature was found. Independent experiments were done for the validation of the drying model.},

abstract = {The aim of this contribution is partly to build consensus on a consistent modelling methodology (CMM) of complex real processes in wastewater treatment by combining classical concepts with results from applied mathematics, and partly to apply it to the clarification-thickening process in the secondary settling tank. In the CMM, the real process should be approximated by a mathematical model (process model; ordinary or partial differential equation (ODE or PDE)), which in turn is approximated by a simulation model (numerical method) implemented on a computer. These steps have often not been carried out in a correct way. The secondary settling tank was chosen as a case since this is one of the most complex processes in a wastewater treatment plant and simulation models developed decades ago have no guarantee of satisfying fundamental mathematical and physical properties. Nevertheless, such methods are still used in commercial tools to date. This particularly becomes of interest as the state-of-the-art practice is moving towards plant-wide modelling. Then all submodels interact and errors propagate through the model and severely hamper any calibration effort and, hence, the predictive purpose of the model. The CMM is described by applying it first to a simple conversion process in the biological reactor yielding an ODE solver, and then to the solid-liquid separation in the secondary settling tank, yielding a PDE solver. Time has come to incorporate established mathematical techniques into environmental engineering, and wastewater treatment modelling in particular, and to use proven reliable and consistent simulation models.},

@article{Ratto2001,
abstract = {A new approach is presented applicable in framework of model calibration to observed data. The approach consists of a combination of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation technique (GLUE) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). The method is based on multiple model evaluations. The GSA is a quantitative, model independent approach and is based on estimating the fractional contribution of each input factor to the variance of the model output, also accounting for interaction terms. In GLUE, the model runs are classified according to a likelihood measure, conditioning each run to observations. In calibration procedures, strong interaction is observed between model parameters, due to model over-parameterization. The use of likelihood measures allows an estimate of the posterior joint pdf of parameters. By performing a GSA to the likelihood measure, input factors mainly driving model runs with good fit to data are identified. Moreover GSA allows highlighting the basic features of the interaction structure. Any other tool subsequently adopted to represent in more detail the interaction structure, from correlation coefficients to Principal Component Analysis to Bayesian networks to tree-structured density estimation, confirms the general features identified by GSA.},

abstract = {Urban sources of water pollution have often been cited as the primary cause of poor water quality in receiving water bodies (RWB), and recently many studies have been conducted to investigate both continuous sources, such as wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, and intermittent sources, such as combined sewer overflows (CSOs). An urban drainage system must be considered jointly, i.e., by means of an integrated approach. However, although the benefits of an integrated approach have been widely demonstrated, several aspects have prevented its wide application, such as the scarcity of field data for not only the input and output variables but also parameters that govern intermediate stages of the system, which are useful for robust calibration. These factors, along with the high complexity level of the currently adopted approaches, introduce uncertainties in the modelling process that are not always identifiable. In this study, the identifiability analysis was applied to a complex integrated catchment: the Nocella basin (Italy). This system is characterised by two main urban areas served by two WWTPs and has a small river as the RWB. The system was simulated by employing an integrated model developed in previous studies. The main goal of the study was to assess the right number of parameters that can be estimated on the basis of data-source availability. A preliminary sensitivity analysis was undertaken to reduce the model parameters to the most sensitive ones. Subsequently, the identifiability analysis was carried out by progressively considering new data sources and assessing the added value provided by each of them. In the process, several identifiability methods were compared and some new techniques were proposed for reducing subjectivity of the analysis. The study showed the potential of the identifiability analysis for selecting the most relevant parameters in the model, thus allowing for model simplification, and in assessing the impact of data sources for model reliability, thus guiding the analyst in the design of future monitoring campaigns. Further, the analysis showed some critical points in integrated urban drainage modelling, such as the interaction between water quality processes on the catchment and in the sewer, that can prevent the identifiability of some of the related parameters.},

@phdthesis{VanderKwast2009,
abstract = {There is an urgent need for operational models that can accurately predict soil moisture patterns in space and time. High spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture and its low degree of autocorrelation complicate the modelling with process-based models. The aim of this research was to evaluate different methods to estimate top soil moisture patterns in terms of accuracy, coverage and support: field measurements, process-based modelling and remote sensing based modelling. Additionally, a data assimilation approach that combines the advantages of each method for operational soil moisture modelling was developed and evaluated. In this research three study sites, Barrax (Spain), Sehoul (Morocco) and La Peyne (France), were used. The accuracy, support and coverage of field measurements of top soil moisture was evaluated using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) measurements in the Sehoul study area. For the evaluation of a process-based model, the Soil Moisture System (SOMS) model has been developed. SOMS estimates the evolution of top soil moisture patterns for agricultural and semi-natural areas after rainfall events. Remote sensing can be used to estimate soil moisture patterns using empirical, non-linear, relationships between surface temperature, vegetation indices and soil moisture content. On the other hand, remote sensing can provide valuable spatial input data for process-based models, e.g. land cover data, albedo and actual evapotranspiration (AET). The calculation of AET using the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model was explained and evaluated with field measurements from the Barrax study area. In addition am upscaling algorithm, DisTrad, that can be used to estimate sub-pixel temperatures from remote sensing images was evaluated. For the integrated approach, which uses field measurements (TDR), a process-based model (SOMS) and remote sensing data from MODIS, a particle filter data assimilation algorithm was implemented. The algorithm integrates AET derived from remote sensing using error propagation scenarios of SEBS with error propagation scenarios of SOMS. Factors influencing the performance of the particle filter algorithm have been identified. It can be concluded that the use of a particular method for the derivation of soil moisture patterns in space and time depends on the specific demands of the application in terms of support and coverage, in relation with the uncertainty of the method. For applications demanding spatially distributed, operational, soil moisture predictions, the assimilation of all available data, either remote sensing data or field measurements, in a process-based model can benefit from the advantages of each method separately. In this case, the particle filter algorithm used in this study can give good results. Further research is needed to confirm this. Because the availability of field measurements of soil moisture and high resolution, cloudless, remote sensing images with a good temporal coverage remains a problem, research should focus on the optimal use of the many datasets that are available in order to provide operational models for the many environmental problems that we are facing. New data assimilation algorithms can play an important role in this research.},

abstract = {The Xplorah Planning Support Systems has been under development since 2000 to provide the Puerto Rico Planning Board with an advanced capacity to forecast land-use changes as the result of various scenarios and to assess alternative planning and policy options in their fully integrated, dynamic and spatial context. To fully deploy the analytic capabilities of Xplorah, high quality geographically referenced data are a necessity. These are typically available from Geographical Information Systems at the Planning Board, or other government agencies. The most crucial of all GIS data layers are high quality time series of land-use maps. In order to facilitate regular updating of the land-use map featuring all 21 land-use classes of Xplorah, while assuring a high accuracy, an automatic image processing procedure is being developed. In this procedure the contextual reclassiﬁcation algorithm OSPARK (Optimised Spatial Reclassiﬁcation Kernel) is applied to level-sliced, segmented pre-classiﬁcation of digital aerial photographs with blue, green, red and near-infrared bands. Like SPARK, it is a kernel-based reclassiﬁcation algorithm, however it automatically adapts the kernel size as a function of spatial variation in the neighbourhood of each pixel to be classiﬁed. The algorithm uses the conﬁguration of objects within a kernel in order to effectively discriminate functional land-use classes and land cover. This paper presents the automatic classiﬁcation procedure and evaluates the results using independent land-use data derived from visual interpretation. Suggestions to improve the procedure are given.},

abstract = {In order to quantify total error affecting hydrological models and predictions, we must explicitly recognize errors in input data, model structure, model parameters and validation data. This paper tackles the last of these: errors in discharge measurements used to calibrate a rainfall-runoff model, caused by stage-discharge rating-curve uncertainty. This uncertainty may be due to several combined sources, including errors in stage and velocity measurements during individual gaugings, assumptions regarding a particular form of stage-discharge relationship, extrapolation of the stage-discharge relationship beyond the maximum gauging, and cross-section change due to vegetation growth and/or bed movement. A methodology is presented to systematically assess and quantify the uncertainty in discharge measurements due to all of these sources. For a given stage measurement, a complete PDF of true discharge is estimated. Consequently, new model calibration techniques can be introduced to explicitly account for the discharge error distribution. The method is demonstrated for a gravel-bed river in New Zealand, where all the above uncertainty sources can be identified, including significant uncertainty in cross-section form due to scour and re-deposition of sediment. Results show that rigorous consideration of uncertainty in flow data results in significant improvement of the model's ability to predict the observed flow.

Model improvements were carried out based on the results of a mathematical identifiability analysis. This analysis provided important information with respect to the balance between model complexity and data availability. Using the identifiability analysis results, we were able to (1) highlight weaknesses of the model; (2) obtain information on how the model could be reduced in some places, to improve its identifiability properties, and extended in others, to enhance model performance; (3) identify which measurements are necessary to optimally calibrate the model. The resulting improved model was less complex (contained less unidentifiable parameters), had better dynamic properties and was able to better describe the stress data set.},

abstract = {DAISY (Differential Algebra for Identifiability of SYstems) is a recently developed computer algebra software tool which can be used to automatically check global identifiability of (linear and) nonlinear dynamic models described by differential equations involving polynomial or rational functions. Global identifiability is a fundamental prerequisite for model identification which is important not only for biological or medical systems but also for many physical and engineering systems derived from first principles. Lack of identifiability implies that the parameter estimation techniques may not fail but any obtained numerical estimates will be meaningless. The software does not require understanding of the underlying mathematical principles and can be used by researchers in applied fields with a minimum of mathematical background. We illustrate the DAISY software by checking the a priori global identifiability of two benchmark nonlinear models taken from the literature. The analysis of these two examples includes comparison with other methods and demonstrates how identifiability analysis is simplified by this tool. Thus we illustrate the identifiability analysis of other two examples, by including discussion of some specific aspects related to the role of observability and knowledge of initial conditions in testing identifiability and to the computational complexity of the software. The main focus of this paper is not on the description of the mathematical background of the algorithm, which has been presented elsewhere, but on illustrating its use and on some of its more interesting features.

abstract = {In a coupled system of two enzyme-catalysed reactions the concentration of the final product follows a sigmoidal progress curve. The shape of this curve is dependent on the concentrations and kinetic properties of both enzymes in the system; provided that the activities of the two enzymes are similar, the kinetic properties of both enzymes may be determined simultaneously by analysis of such curves. The value of this approach is substantiated using a model system consisting of pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) and lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27). Analysis of the data by a combination of numerical integration and nonlinear regression yielded values for the kinetic parameters which are in excellent agreement with those determined from measurements of steady-state rates. Appropriate experimental designs for this type of progress curve analysis are considered. The analysis is compared with, and is shown to be of much greater generality than, published procedures involving measurements of the early stages of progress curves.},

However, very few reports are available in the scientific literature determining the equilibrium constant (K) for the transamination of ketones. Various methods for determining (or estimating) equilibrium have previously been suggested, both experimental as well as computational (based on group contribution methods). However, none of these were found suitable for determining the equilibrium constant for the transamination of ketones. Therefore, in this communication we suggest a simple experimental methodology which we hope will stimulate more accurate determination of thermodynamic equilibria when reporting the results of transaminase-catalyzed reactions in order to increase understanding of the relationship between substrate and product molecular structure on reaction thermodynamics.

abstract = {A priori global identifiability is a structural property of biological and physiological models. It is considered a prerequisite for well-posed estimation, since it concerns the possibility of recovering uniquely the unknown model parameters from measured input-output data, under ideal conditions (noise-free observations and error-free model structure). Of course, determining if the parameters can be uniquely recovered from observed data is essential before investing resources, time and effort in performing actual biomedical experiments. Many interesting biological models are nonlinear but identifiability analysis for nonlinear system turns out to be a difficult mathematical problem. Different methods have been proposed in the literature to test identifiability of nonlinear models but, to the best of our knowledge, so far no software tools have been proposed for automatically checking identifiability of nonlinear models. In this paper, we describe a software tool implementing a differential algebra algorithm to perform parameter identifiability analysis for (linear and) nonlinear dynamic models described by polynomial or rational equations. Our goal is to provide the biological investigator a completely automatized software, requiring minimum prior knowledge of mathematical modelling and no in-depth understanding of the mathematical tools. The DAISY (Differential Algebra for Identifiability of SYstems) software will potentially be useful in biological modelling studies, especially in physiology and clinical medicine, where research experiments are particularly expensive and/or difficult to perform. Practical examples of use of the software tool DAISY are presented. DAISY is available at the web site http://www.dei.unipd.it/\~{}pia/.},

abstract = {Effective estimation of parameters in biocatalytic reaction kinetic expressions are very important when building process models to enable evaluation of process technology options and alternative biocatalysts. The kinetic models used to describe enzyme-catalyzed reactions generally include several parameters, which are strongly correlated with each other. State-of-the-art methodologies such as nonlinear regression (using progress curves) or graphical analysis (using initial rate data, for example, the Lineweaver-Burke plot, Hanes plot or Dixon plot) often incorporate errors in the estimates and rarely lead to globally optimized parameter values. In this article, a robust methodology to estimate parameters for biocatalytic reaction kinetic expressions is proposed. The methodology determines the parameters in a systematic manner by exploiting the best features of several of the current approaches. The parameter estimation problem is decomposed into five hierarchical steps, where the solution of each of the steps becomes the input for the subsequent step to achieve the final model with the corresponding regressed parameters. The model is further used for validating its performance and determining the correlation of the parameters. The final model with the fitted parameters is able to describe both initial rate and dynamic experiments. Application of the methodology is illustrated with a case study using the $\omega$-transaminase catalyzed synthesis of 1-phenylethylamine from acetophenone and 2-propylamine. © 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

abstract = {Analysing the properties of a biological system through in silico experimentation requires a satisfactory mathematical representation of the system including accurate values of the model parameters. Fortunately, modern experimental techniques allow obtaining time-series data of appropriate quality which may then be used to estimate unknown parameters. However, in many cases, a subset of those parameters may not be uniquely estimated, independently of the experimental data available or the numerical techniques used for estimation. This lack of identifiability is related to the structure of the model, i.e. the system dynamics plus the observation function. Despite the interest in knowing a priori whether there is any chance of uniquely estimating all model unknown parameters, the structural identifiability analysis for general non-linear dynamic models is still an open question. There is no method amenable to every model, thus at some point we have to face the selection of one of the possibilities. This work presents a critical comparison of the currently available techniques. To this end, we perform the structural identifiability analysis of a collection of biological models. The results reveal that the generating series approach, in combination with identifiability tableaus, offers the most advantageous compromise among range of applicability, computational complexity and information provided.},

Therefore, the determination of an enzyme's kinetic parameters is crucial. For this a systematic experimental design procedure is necessary to avoid wasting time and resources. The parameter estimation error of a Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetic process is analysed analytically to reduce the search area as well as numerically to specify the optimum for parameter estimation. From analytical analysis of the Fisher information matrix the fact is obtained, that an enzyme feed will not improve the estimation process, but substrate feeding is favorable with small volume flow. Unconstrained and constrained process conditions are considered. If substrate fed-batch process design is used instead of pure batch experiments the improvements of the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the variance of parameter estimation error reduces to 82\% for mu(max) and to 60\% for K(m) of the batch values in average.},

This is especially true for the synthesis of symmetric 2-hydroxy ketones from two identical aldehydes, with one substrate acting as the donor and the other as the acceptor. In this contribution, a systematic approach for deriving such a kinetic model for thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes is presented. The derived mechanistic kinetic model takes this donor-acceptor principle into account by containing two K(m)-values even for identical substrate molecules. As example the stereoselective carbon-carbon coupling of two 3,5-dimethoxy-benzaldehyde molecules to (R)-3,3',5,5'-tetramethoxy-benzoin using benzaldehyde lyase (EC 4.1.2.38) from Pseudomonas fluorescens is studied. The model is derived using a model-based experimental analysis method which includes parameter estimation, model analysis, optimal experimental design, in silico experiments, sensitivity analysis and model revision. It is shown that this approach leads to a robust kinetic model with accurate parameter estimates and an excellent prediction capability.},

When identifiability problems occur, these are obscured by redundancy occurring among the steady-state parameters. This redundancy is only partly revealed by the known Haldane relations. We found the additional constraints between the parameters. These relations allow to predict in which situation rate constants are identifiable by steady-state kinetic methods.

These parameters and the model are then said to be unidentifiable. Finding identifiable combinations of parameters with which to reparameterize the model provides a means for quantitatively analyzing the model and computing solutions in terms of the combinations. In this paper, we revisit and explore the properties of an algorithm for finding identifiable parameter combinations using Gr\"{o}bner Bases and prove useful theoretical properties of these parameter combinations. We prove a set of M algebraically independent identifiable parameter combinations can be found using this algorithm and that there exists a unique rational reparameterization of the input-output equations over these parameter combinations.

The half saturation constant for H (2) uptake by a mixed-culture, CH(4) producing enrichment was measured using an experimental protocol that avoided internal mass transfer limitations. The value obtained was two orders of magnitude smaller than any other previously reported. A mathematical model for acetogenic syntrophic associations was developed to check the capacity of H(2) as electron transporter between syntrophic partners. It was found that H(2) diffusion could account for the rate of transport of electrons between the syntrophic microorganisms and that formate is not a necessary intermediate. The possibility that formate may be an intermediate in this system was not ruled out. A Monod-type kinetic equation was modified to include the observed H(2) threshold effect. This modified equation was used to predict the CH(4)-production rate in a batch-fed digester. The results show that the external and internal H(2) pools are kinetically coupled.},

abstract = {Nitrification is a two-step process in which ammonia is incompletely oxidized by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria or archaea (AOB) to nitrite, which is then further oxidized to nitrate by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Literature reports show that segregation of initially coexisting ammonia and nitrite oxidizing populations co-immobilized in gel cubes and cultured in a set-up with three reactors in series (without recirculation) is attained. In those studies NOB were present and nitrite was oxidized mainly in the last reactor. We developed a mathematical model for immobilized biomass that allows for one-dimensional gradients of metabolites and changes of porosity within the gel due to growth. The model reproduced the experimentally observed compartmentalization under the conditions used by Noto et al. (Noto et al., 1998. Water Res 32(3): 769- 773), using standard kinetic parameters of nitrifying bacteria including free ammonia inhibition of AOB and NOB. The model predicted compartmentalization when the ammonium load was sufficiently high and liquid phase mixing sufficiently limited (close to plug-flow). Modeling results demonstrated that inhibition of NOB by free ammonia did not substantially contribute to the compartmentalization in biofilm reactors. Additional simulations identified the higher oxygen affinity of AOB as the key parameter leading to compartmentalization (i.e., partial nitrification) in artificial and natural biofilms since they enable the formation of oxygen gradients. As a result, a tendency for compartmentalization was found even at equal competitiveness.},

The results indicate that at pH-levels below 6.9 AMB will outcompete ASRB, whereas above a pH of 7.7, ASRB will win the competition. If ASRB and AMB are present in granular sludge growth will be found in a wider pH-range than if they are present as suspended sludge. The affinities for acetate and the sulfide toxicity are dependent on the sludge form as well. In granular sludge the acetate affinities of ASRB and AMB are comparable, whereas in suspended sludge ASRB show a lower affinity than AMB. With respect to sulfide toxicity, the results indicate that above pH 7 sulfide inhibition in granular sludge is caused by the total sulfide concentration, while in suspended sludge the free H2S-concentration determines the toxicity. At high pH-levels growth is stronger inhibited than the activity.},

abstract = {The Monod equation is often used to describe biological treatment processes and is the foundation for many activated sludge models. The Monod equation includes a "half-saturation coefficient" to describe the effect of substrate limitations on the process rate and it is customary to consider this parameter to be a constant for a given system. The purpose of this study was to develop a methodology, and its use to show that the half-saturation coefficient for denitrification is not constant but is in fact a function of the maximum denitrification rate. A 4-step procedure is developed to investigate the dependency of half-saturation coefficients on the maximum rate and two different models are used to describe this dependency: (a) an empirical linear model and (b) a deterministic model based on Fick's law of diffusion. Both models are proved better for describing denitrification kinetics than assuming a fixed K(NO3) at low nitrate concentrations. The empirical model is more utilitarian whereas the model based on Fick's law has a fundamental basis that enables the intrinsic K(NO3) to be estimated. In this study data was analyzed from 56 denitrification rate tests and it was found that the extant K(NO3) varied between 0.07 mgN/L and 1.47 mgN/L (5th and 95th percentile respectively) with an average of 0.47 mgN/L. In contrast to this, the intrinsic K(NO3) estimated for the diffusion model was 0.01 mgN/L which indicates that the extant K(NO3) is greatly influenced by, and mostly describes, diffusion limitations.},

In monitored batch experiments, biomass from four different full-scale partial nitritation-anammox plants was subjected to anoxic periods of 5-60 min. Ammonium and the nitrite that was produced were present to reproduce reactor conditions and enable ammonium and nitrite oxidation at the same time. The lag phase observed in nitrite oxidation exceeded the lag phase in ammonium oxidation after anoxic periods of more than 15-20 min. Lower temperatures slowed down the conversion rates but did not affect the lag phases. The operational oxygen concentration in the originating full scale plants strongly affected the length of the lag phase, which could be attributed to different species of Nitrospira spp. detected by DGGE and sequencing analysis.},

The difficulties are further illuminated by estimation examples using real data. It certain situations, in which the value of the ratio Ks/so is high or in which only few and noisy measurements are available, the linear approximation of the Michaelis-Menten equation gives a better fit. The practical difficulties in obtaining correct values of the model parameters do not limit the applicability of the Michaelis-Menten model, which in most cases explains the bacterial growth behavior excellently. Rather, they underline the fact that care must be taken when utilizing parameter estimates for biological interpretations.},

Measurement of mu at selected dissolved oxygen concentrations (DO) resulted in a typical Monod curve for a plot of mu vs. DO. Values for K(DO) and mu(max) were obtained from the Lineweaver-Burk reciprocal plot. The bacteria studied included representative strains of three microorganisms isolated in pure culture from poorly settling activated sludge: two filamentous microorganisms, Sphaerotilus natans and a second Sphaerotilus sp., and an unidentified floc-forming microorganism. The K(DO) values obtained for Sphaerotilus sp., S. natans, and the floc former were 0.014, 0.033, and 0.073 mg/L, respectively. Dual species competition experiments were conducted in continuous culture under low and high DO conditions. Successful growth competition by these microorganisms under DO-limiting conditions was consistent with experimentally determined K(DO) values.

The main focus was on the influence of key biokinetic parameters (maximum specific growth rates, oxygen and nitrogen affinity constants of AOB (ammonium oxidizing bacteria) and NOB (nitrite oxidizing bacteria)) and their ratios on nitritation efficiency in these geometries. This exhaustive simulation study revealed that nitritation strongly depends on the chosen kinetic parameters of AOB and NOB. The maximum specific growth rates ($\mu$max,AOB and $\mu$max,NOB) had the strongest impact on nitritation efficiency (NE). In comparison, the counter-diffusion geometry yielded more parameter combinations (27.5\%) that resulted in high NE than the co-diffusion geometry (7.9\%). The oxygen concentrations at the relevant biofilm interfaces (membrane/biofilm for counter-diffusion or bulk/biofilm for co-diffusion) were not predictive of NE. However, the maximum allowable oxygen concentration to maintain higher NE was higher for the counter-diffusion geometry.},

Using this approach, the influence of internal and external mass transfer could be estimated. First, the apparent Monod constant (K(S)) for each data set was calculated by means of a curve-fitting procedure. The experimental results revealed that variations in the V(up) did not affect the apparent K(S)-value, indicating that external mass-transport resistance normally can be neglected. With regard to the granule size, a clear increase in K(S) was found at increasing granule diameters. The experimental data were further used to validate a dynamic mathematical biofilm model. The biofilm model was able to describe reaction-diffusion kinetics in anaerobic granules, using a single value for the effective diffusion coefficient in the granules. This suggests that biogas formation did not influence the diffusion-rates in the granular biomass.},

abstract = {The influence of membrane separation and mass transfer effects on the kinetics of nitrifiers was evaluated by running a membrane bioreactor (MBR) and a conventional activated sludge (CAS) plant in parallel. Both pilot plants were operated at the same sludge age and treated the same domestic wastewater. The half-saturation constants for the substrate were low in both MBR and CAS and did not differ significantly between the two processes (K(NH(4))) and 0.14+/-0.10 g(N)m(-3) and (K(NO(2))) and 0.28+/-0.20 g(N)m(-3) for the MBR and CAS, respectively). However, the half-saturation constants for oxygen exhibited a major difference between the two processes for both the ammonia-oxidizing (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing (NOB) bacteria. The experiments yielded K(O,AOB)=0.18+/-0.04 and 0.79+/-0.08 g(O2) as well as K(O,NOB)=0.13+/-0.06 and 0.47+/-0.04 g(O2) m(-3) (substrate only NO(2)) for the MBR and CAS, respectively. The higher K(0) values of the CAS were attributed to mass transfer effects within the large flocs prevailing in the conventional system. In contrast, the sludge from the MBR consisted of very small flocs for which the diffusion resistance can be neglected. On the basis of these results, the implementation of mass transfer effects in activated sludge models is discussed and consequences for the operation of MBRs are highlighted.},

abstract = {Partial nitrification to nitrite (nitritation) can be achieved in a continuous process without sludge retention by wash out of nitrite oxidising bacteria (NOB) while retaining ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB), at elevated temperatures (the SHARON process) and, as demonstrated in this paper, also at low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Enriched AOB was attained at a low DO concentration (0.4 mg l(-1)) and a dilution rate of 0.42 day(-1) in a continuous process. A higher oxygen affinity of AOB compared to NOB seemed critical to achieving this. This was verified by determining the oxygen half saturation constant, Ko, with similar oxygen mass transfer resistances for enriched AOB and NOB as 0.033+/-0.003 mg l(-1) and 0.43+/-0.08 mg l(-1), respectively. However, the extent of nitritation attained was found to be highly sensitive to process upsets.},

@article{Brockmann2008,
abstract = {Parameter estimation and model calibration are key problems in the application of biofilm models in engineering practice, where a large number of model parameters need to be determined usually based on experimental data with only limited information content. In this article, identifiability of biokinetic parameters of a biofilm model describing two-step nitrification was evaluated based solely on bulk phase measurements of ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate. In addition to evaluating the impact of experimental conditions and available measurements, the influence of mass transport limitation within the biofilm and the initial parameter values on identifiability of biokinetic parameters was evaluated. Selection of parameters for identifiability analysis was based on global mean sensitivities while parameter identifiability was analyzed using local sensitivity functions. At most, four of the six most sensitive biokinetic parameters were identifiable from results of batch experiments at bulk phase dissolved oxygen concentrations of 0.8 or 5 mg O(2)/L. High linear dependences between the parameters of the subsets (KO2,AOB,muAOB) and (KO2,NOB,muNOB) resulted in reduced identifiability. Mass transport limitation within the biofilm did not influence the number of identifiable parameters but, in fact, decreased collinearity between parameters, especially for parameters that are otherwise correlated (e.g., muAOB) and KO2,AOB, or muNOB and KO2,NOB). The choice of the initial parameter values had a significant impact on the identifiability of two parameter subsets, both including the parameters muAOB and KO2,AOB. Parameter subsets that did not include the subsets muAOB and KO2,AOB or muNOB and KO2,NOB were clearly identifiable independently of the choice of the initial parameter values.},

abstract = {Biological nitrogen removal (BNR) based on partial nitrification and denitrification via nitrite is a cost-effective alternate to conventional nitrification and denitrification (via nitrate). The goal of this study was to investigate the microbial ecology, biokinetics, and stability of partial nitrification. Stable long-term partial nitrification resulting in 82.1 +/- 17.2\% ammonia oxidation, primarily to nitrite (77.3 +/- 19.5\% of the ammonia oxidized) was achieved in a lab-scale bioreactor by operation at a pH, dissolved oxygen and solids retention time of 7.5 +/- 0.1, 1.54 +/- 0.87 mg O(2)/L, and 3.0 days, respectively. Bioreactor ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) populations were most closely related to Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter spp., respectively. The AOB population fraction varied in the range 61 +/- 45\% and was much higher than the NOB fraction, 0.71 +/- 1.1\%. Using direct measures of bacterial concentrations in conjunction with independent activity measures and mass balances, the maximum specific growth rate (micro(max)), specific decay (b) and observed biomass yield coefficients (Y(obs)) for AOB were 1.08 +/- 1.03 day(-1), 0.32 +/- 0.34 day(-1), and 0.15 +/- 0.06 mg biomass COD/mg N oxidized, respectively. Corresponding micro(max), b, and Y(obs) values for NOB were 2.6 +/- 2.05 day(-1), 1.7 +/- 1.9 day(-1), and 0.04 +/- 0.02 mg biomass COD/mg N oxidized, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that the highly selective partial nitrification operating conditions enriched for a narrow diversity of rapidly growing AOB and NOB populations unlike conventional BNR reactors, which host a broader diversity of nitrifying bacteria. Further, direct measures of microbial abundance enabled not only elucidation of mixed community microbial ecology but also estimation of key engineering parameters describing bioreactor systems supporting these communities.},

abstract = {Although traditionally not taken into account by most of activated sludge models the production of nitrite as an intermediate of the nitrification-denitrification processes becomes of interest in some specific plant operational situations or in case of high sensitivity of the receiving ecosystems. The Activated Sludge Model No.3 (ASM3) was therefore extended for two-step nitrification and two-step denitrification in order to better describe nitrite dynamics especially during the treatment of communal wastewater. Nitrite was included as a new model compound and as an intermediate product of biological processes, both for heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria. Two new model compounds replace X(A), the original autotrophic biomass: Ammonium Oxidizing Bacteria, X(AOB) and Nitrite Oxidizing Bacteria, X(NOB). Growth and decay processes of nitrifiers were split into AOB and NOB processes (3 additional processes) and heterotrophic anoxic processes were also doubled in order to account for two-step denitrification (4 additional processes). Default values from literature as well as laboratory measurements were considered for the choice of kinetic and stoichiometric parameters. The model was calibrated and validated with laboratory scale tests in batch reactors and with data from an Eawag activated sludge pilot plant configured conventionally with nitrification and pre-denitrification for the treatment of communal wastewater.},

@article{Stenstrom1980,
abstract = {The effect of dissolved oxygen concentration on the rate of nitrification has been investigated by a number of researchers using both pure and mixed cultures, and cultures found in wastewater treatment systems. The maximum growth rate of both nitrification reactions are reported to be affected by dissolved oxygen concentration over the range of 0.3 mg l−1 to as much as 4.0 mg l−1. In some instances, it has been reported that a dissolved oxygen concentration in excess of 4.0 mg l−1 is required to achieve maximum nitrification rates, while other investigators have found that only 0.5 to 1.0 mg l−1 is required. It has been proposed that several factors are responsible for the wide range of reported nitrification rates with varying dissolved oxygen concentrations. Among these factors are the effects of oxygen diffusion in flocs, variation between measured results due to steady-state and dynamic measuring techniques, and double-substrate limited kinetics. This paper reviews the nitrification literature with respect to the effects of dissolved oxygen concentration, and shows that double-substrate limiting kinetics could account for the variation in the reported results.},
